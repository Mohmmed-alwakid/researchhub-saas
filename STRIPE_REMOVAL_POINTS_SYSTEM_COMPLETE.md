  - `points_balance`: User point balances with totals
  - `points_transactions`: Complete transaction history
  - `study_costs`: Study creation cost tracking
- **API Endpoints**: New `/api/points` with full CRUD operations
- **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for points system
- **UI Components**: 
  - User-facing points manager with balance and transaction history
  - Admin interface for assigning points to users
  - Integration with study creation workflow

### 3. Performance Monitoring System ✅
- **Performance Service**: Comprehensive performance monitoring with metrics collection
- **Issue Reporting**: User-friendly issue reporting modal with categorization
- **Floating Report Button**: Always-accessible bug reporting in development
- **Database Schema**: Performance issues and metrics tracking tables
- **API Endpoints**: Full performance monitoring API with admin management

## 🔧 How the Points System Works

### For Researchers
1. **Point Balance**: View current points, total earned, and total spent
2. **Transaction History**: Complete log of all point activities
3. **Study Creation**: Points are automatically deducted when creating studies
4. **Usage Statistics**: Track points spent per study and overall usage

### For Admins
1. **User Management**: View all user point balances and transaction history
2. **Point Assignment**: Assign points to any user with reason tracking
3. **Transaction Monitoring**: View all system transactions across users
4. **Analytics**: Track total points in system and average balances

### Point Costs (Configurable)
- **Base Study Cost**: 50 points
- **Per Block Cost**: 10 points per block
- **Per Participant Cost**: 5 points per expected participant

## 🐛 Performance Monitoring Features

### Issue Reporting
- **Categories**: Performance, Error, UI Issue, Bug, Feature Request
- **Severity Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Auto Data Collection**: Performance metrics, system info, user context
- **Screenshots**: Optional screenshot capture capability

### Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: Full page loading performance
- **Memory Usage**: JavaScript heap usage monitoring
- **Network Requests**: API call tracking
- **Error Monitoring**: Automatic error and rejection capture

### Admin Monitoring
- **Issue Dashboard**: View and manage all reported issues
- **Performance Statistics**: Aggregate performance data
- **User Reporting**: Track issues by user and session

## 🔄 Migration Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Set environment variables
export SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-key"

# Run migrations
node run-migrations.mjs
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Remove these variables:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. Update Application Routes
- Replace `/app/settings/billing` with points management
- Update admin routes to include points management
- Add performance monitoring to admin panel

### 4. Testing
1. **Admin Testing**:
   - Assign points to test users
   - View points transactions and balances
   - Monitor system performance issues

2. **Researcher Testing**:
   - Create studies and verify point deduction
   - View points balance and history
   - Test issue reporting functionality

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Report test issues using floating button
   - Verify performance metrics collection
   - Test admin issue management

## 📊 Expected Benefits

### Cost Reduction
- **No Stripe Fees**: Eliminate 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **No Monthly Subscription**: Remove Stripe monthly costs
- **Simplified Billing**: Admin-controlled point assignment

### Better Control
- **Flexible Pricing**: Admins can adjust point costs per organization
- **Usage Tracking**: Comprehensive analytics on point usage
- **Budget Management**: Precise control over user spending

### Improved UX
- **Instant Access**: No payment flow interruptions
- **Clear Costs**: Transparent point costs for all actions
- **Better Support**: Direct issue reporting with performance data

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Development
- **Test Accounts**: Continue using existing test accounts
- **Local Development**: All features work in local environment
- **Performance Button**: Only shows in development mode by default

### For Production
- **Initial Points**: Admins need to assign initial points to users
- **Cost Configuration**: Review and adjust point costs in API
- **Performance Monitoring**: Consider enabling performance reporting in production

### Security
- **RLS Policies**: All new tables have proper row-level security
- **Admin Only**: Point assignment restricted to admin users
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history for accountability

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**: Push to production after testing
2. **Assign Initial Points**: Give existing users starting point balances
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track point consumption patterns
4. **Adjust Costs**: Fine-tune point costs based on usage data
5. **Performance Review**: Monitor reported issues and system performance

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Use the floating report button (development)
2. Check the browser console for errors
3. Review the API logs for backend issues
4. Contact development team with specific error details
