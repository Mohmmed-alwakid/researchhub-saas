## üí° Remember

**You're doing discovery, not fixing!**
- Don't try to fix anything yet
- Just note what works and what doesn't
- Be thorough - this saves time later
- Even "small" issues are worth noting

**The Vibe-Coder Way:**
1. ‚úÖ Discover thoroughly (you're here!)
2. Plan systematically (next!)
3. Fix incrementally (soon!)
4. Test immediately (always!)
5. Document everything (continuously!)
