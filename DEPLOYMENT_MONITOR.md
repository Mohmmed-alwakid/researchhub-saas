# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Monitor

## Deployment Steps Progress:
- [ ] 1. Signed in to Railway
- [ ] 2. Created new project from GitHub repo
- [ ] 3. Added all environment variables
- [ ] 4. Deployment started automatically
- [ ] 5. Build process completed successfully
- [ ] 6. Service is running

## Build Process Monitor:
Railway will run these commands automatically:
âœ… `npm install` - Install dependencies
âœ… `npm run build` - Build the application
âœ… `npm start` - Start the server

## Expected Build Output:
- Frontend build: ~55KB CSS, ~1MB JS
- Backend build: TypeScript compilation
- Health check: Available at `/api/health`

## After Deployment Success:
Railway will provide a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] Frontend loads: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] MongoDB connection working

## Common Issues & Solutions:
- Build fails: Check environment variables are set correctly
- Health check fails: Verify `/api/health` endpoint exists
- App won't start: Check `npm start` script in package.json
- Database errors: Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string

## Your MongoDB Connection:
âœ… Username: abwanwr77
âœ… Cluster: cluster0.ackancs.mongodb.net
âœ… Database access configured
