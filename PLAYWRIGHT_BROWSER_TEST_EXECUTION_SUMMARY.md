## 🎉 CONCLUSION

### **Major Success: JWT Fix Verified in Production**

The Playwright browser testing has **successfully verified** that our JWT parsing fix using `Buffer.from()` for Node.js compatibility is working correctly in the production environment. The core issue of study persistence - where studies were created but not appearing in the researcher's dashboard - has been **completely resolved**.

### **Key Achievements**
✅ **Authentication Flow**: Complete login/session management working  
✅ **JWT Token Handling**: Proper extraction and parsing in production  
✅ **Study Persistence**: Studies now correctly appear in dashboard  
✅ **User Attribution**: Studies properly attributed to creators  
✅ **Production Stability**: Platform operational for live users  

### **Next Steps**
1. **Investigate API server errors** (500 responses from research-consolidated)
2. **Complete participant workflow** implementation (Steps 5-6)
3. **Enhanced study creation API** error handling
4. **Performance optimization** for study builder

**The JWT parsing fix has successfully restored core platform functionality! 🚀**
