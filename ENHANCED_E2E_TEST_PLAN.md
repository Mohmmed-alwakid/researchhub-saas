## ðŸŽ¯ **ENHANCED TEST IMPLEMENTATION**

This comprehensive test plan should be implemented as:

1. **Automated Playwright Test** - For regression testing
2. **Manual Testing Checklist** - For detailed validation
3. **Performance Testing** - Time tracking and load testing
4. **Cross-browser Testing** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
5. **Mobile Responsive Testing** - Touch interactions and mobile UX

The test provides **complete end-to-end validation** of your ResearchHub platform, ensuring every user journey works flawlessly from study creation through results analysis.

Would you like me to implement this as a detailed Playwright test script with all these validation points?
