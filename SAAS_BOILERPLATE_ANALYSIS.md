1. ❌ Set you back by MONTHS
2. ❌ Replace working code with unknown code
3. ❌ Create massive migration headaches
4. ❌ Lose your custom Study Builder system
5. ❌ Abandon 80% completed features

| **Auth** | Supabase Auth (✅ Working) | Clerk ($$$) | ✅ **You win** (free) |
| **Database** | Supabase PostgreSQL (✅ Working) | Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL | ⚖️ Both good |
| **Backend** | Vercel Functions (✅ Working) | Next.js API Routes | ⚖️ Similar |
| **UI** | Custom + Tailwind (✅ Working) | Shadcn UI + Tailwind | ⚖️ Both good |
| **Testing** | Playwright (✅ Working) | Playwright + Vitest | ✅ **You have it** |

6. You'd abandon working authentication
7. You'd replace optimized APIs with new code

### **INSTEAD: Fix What You Have**

You have a **working platform** with a **unique value proposition** (Study Builder system). Your next step is:

1. ✅ Test remaining 2 accounts (10 minutes)
2. ✅ Identify real issues (if any)
3. ✅ Fix top 3 priorities (1-2 weeks)
4. ✅ Launch to real users

## 🤔 **When WOULD This Boilerplate Be Useful?**

This boilerplate would only make sense if:
- ❌ You were starting from **scratch** (you're not)
- ❌ You had **no code written** (you have 80% done)
- ❌ You wanted **Next.js specifically** (React works fine)
- ❌ You preferred **Clerk** over Supabase (Supabase works)
- ❌ You had **unlimited time** (you want to launch)

**None of these apply to you.** ❌
