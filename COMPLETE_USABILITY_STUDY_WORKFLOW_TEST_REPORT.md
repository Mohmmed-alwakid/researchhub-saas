## 🚨 Issues Identified & Analysis

### Frontend UI Component Issues ⚠️

#### 1. Study Application Form (User Story 3)
**Location**: Study Application Page (`/app/studies/{id}/apply`)  
**Impact**: Medium - Blocks application submission workflow  
**Status**: Page loads but form content not rendering
**Root Cause**: StudyApplicationPage component rendering issues

#### 2. Application Management Interface (User Story 4)  
**Location**: Study Applications Page (`/app/studies/{id}/applications`)
**Impact**: Medium - Blocks researcher application management
**Status**: Page loads but application list content not rendering  
**Root Cause**: StudyApplicationsPage component rendering issues

### Potential Technical Causes
1. **React Component Lifecycle**: Components may have mounting/rendering issues
2. **API Integration**: Backend endpoints for applications may not be fully implemented
3. **Data Fetching**: Async data loading patterns may need improvement
4. **Error Handling**: Silent failures in API calls or component rendering

### Recommendations for Resolution
1. **Debug React Components**: 
   - Investigate StudyApplicationPage and StudyApplicationsPage components
   - Check component mounting and data fetching lifecycle
   - Verify error boundaries and loading states

2. **Backend API Development**:
   - Implement `POST /api/study-applications` for application submission
   - Implement `GET /api/studies/{id}/applications` for application retrieval  
   - Implement `PUT /api/study-applications/{id}` for status updates

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Verify API response format handling
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Add proper loading states for async operations
