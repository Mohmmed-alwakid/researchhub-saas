## 🔮 NEXT STEPS ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Backend Integration (Immediate)
```typescript
// API Integration Points
interface StudyBuilderAPI {
  createStudy: (studyData: StudyData) => Promise<Study>;
  saveProgress: (wizardState: WizardProgress) => Promise<void>;
  loadTemplate: (templateId: string) => Promise<Template>;
  validateStudy: (studyData: StudyData) => Promise<ValidationResult>;
}
```

**Priority Tasks:**
1. **Study Creation API** - Connect wizard to backend study creation
2. **Progress Persistence** - Save/restore wizard state
3. **Template API** - Real template loading and management
4. **Validation API** - Server-side study validation

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Short-term)
```typescript
// Collaboration Features
interface CollaborationFeatures {
  realTimeEditing: boolean;
  commentSystem: boolean;
  approvalWorkflow: boolean;
  versionControl: boolean;
}
```

**Enhancement Areas:**
1. **Real-time Collaboration** - Multi-user study creation
2. **Template Creation UI** - Visual template builder
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Study performance tracking
4. **Bulk Operations** - Advanced study management

### Phase 3: Enterprise Platform (Long-term)
```typescript
// Enterprise Features
interface EnterpriseFeatures {
  roleBasedPermissions: AdvancedRBAC;
  auditTrail: AuditLog[];
  advancedIntegrations: IntegrationAPI;
  customBranding: BrandingConfig;
}
```

**Strategic Initiatives:**
1. **Enterprise RBAC** - Advanced role and permission system
2. **Audit & Compliance** - Complete audit trails
