  - `collaboration/index.ts` - Added new component exports

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
src/client/components/collaboration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CollaborationHeader.tsx          ‚úÖ Enhanced
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CollaborationSidebar.tsx          ‚úÖ New
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CollaborativeStudyBuilderContainer.tsx  ‚úÖ New (Advanced)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                         ‚úÖ Updated exports

src/client/pages/studies/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StudyBuilderPage.tsx             ‚úÖ Enhanced with collaboration
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Added to StudyBuilderPage.tsx
const [showCollaborationSidebar, setShowCollaborationSidebar] = useState(false);

// CollaborationHeader integration
<CollaborationHeader
  onShowComments={() => setShowCollaborationSidebar(true)}
  onShowActivity={() => setShowCollaborationSidebar(true)}
/>

// CollaborationSidebar integration
<CollaborationSidebar
  studyTitle={watch('title') || 'New Study'}
  isOpen={showCollaborationSidebar}
  onToggle={() => setShowCollaborationSidebar(!showCollaborationSidebar)}
/>
```

### Mock Data Integration
The implementation includes comprehensive mock data for demonstration:
- **Team Members**: Active and idle status indicators
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time activity simulation
- **Comments**: Ready for integration with comment system
- **Presence Indicators**: Visual status representation

## üé® User Experience Design

### Non-Intrusive Integration
- **Primary Focus**: Study building workflow remains unchanged
- **Collaborative Enhancement**: Team features enhance without disrupting
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Collaboration features available when needed
- **Responsive Design**: Sidebar adapts to screen size and content

### Visual Design Elements
- **Status Indicators**: Green/yellow/gray presence dots
- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean organization of team/comments/activity
- **Floating Toggle**: Easy access when sidebar is closed
- **Real-time Updates**: Study title updates in collaboration header as user types

## üîß Development Integration

### Local Development Testing
```bash
# Start full-stack development environment
npm run dev:fullstack

# Frontend: http://localhost:5175
# Backend: http://localhost:3003
# Study Builder: http://localhost:5175/app/studies/new
```

### TypeScript Safety
- ‚úÖ All components properly typed
- ‚úÖ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Proper prop interfaces and state management
- ‚úÖ Event handlers with correct typing

### Component Exports
```typescript
// Updated collaboration/index.ts
export { default as CollaborationHeader } from './CollaborationHeader';
export { default as CollaborationSidebar } from './CollaborationSidebar';
export { default as CollaborativeStudyBuilderContainer } from './CollaborativeStudyBuilderContainer';
```
