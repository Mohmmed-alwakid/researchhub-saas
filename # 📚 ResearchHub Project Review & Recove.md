## 🔧 COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### **Problem: "I don't know what to work on"**
```bash
# Solution 1: Check your requirements tracker
cat docs/requirements/00_MASTER_INDEX.md

# Solution 2: Test the core user flow
# 1. Sign up as researcher
# 2. Create a study
# 3. Launch it
# 4. Complete as participant
# Note what breaks and fix that
```

### **Problem: "Too many files and folders"**
```bash
# Solution: Use the automated cleanup
npm run cleanup                    # Organizes everything
npm run cleanup:dry-run           # Preview first
node scripts/cleanup/master-cleanup.js  # Full report
```

### **Problem: "Can't add new API endpoint"**
```javascript
// Solution: Add to existing consolidated function
// Instead of creating new api/my-feature.js
// Add to api/research-consolidated.js or similar:

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { action } = req.query;
  
  switch (action) {
    case 'existing-action': return existingHandler(req, res);
    case 'your-new-action': return yourNewHandler(req, res);  // ADD HERE
  }
}
```

### **Problem: "TypeScript errors blocking me"**
```bash
# Solution: Quick fixes
npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck    # See only real errors

# In your code, if third-party issues:
// @ts-ignore
import { ProblematicLibrary } from 'some-package';
```

### **Problem: "Production site not working"**
```bash
# Solution: Debug checklist
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Check network tab for failed API calls
3. Test API directly: https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app/api/health
4. Check Vercel dashboard for function errors
5. Review recent commits: git log --oneline -10
```

## 📋 RECOVERY ACTION PLANS

### **Plan A: Quick Win (1-2 hours)**
Focus on ONE small broken feature:
```bash
1. Pick one specific issue (e.g., "Login button doesn't work")
2. Test it locally: npm run dev:fullstack
3. Fix the specific issue
4. Test the fix
5. Deploy: git add . && git commit -m "fix: login button" && git push
6. Verify on production
```

### **Plan B: Clean House (Half Day)**
Organize and understand what you have:
```bash
1. Run cleanup: npm run cleanup
2. Archive old docs: Move to archive/ folder
3. Update README.md with current status
4. Delete duplicate files
5. Create simple CURRENT_STATUS.md listing what works/doesn't
6. Commit everything: git add . && git commit -m "cleanup: organized project"
```

### **Plan C: Core Flow Fix (1-2 Days)**
Ensure basic user journey works:
```bash
1. Test as Researcher:
   - Sign up/Login
   - Create study
   - Add blocks
   - Launch study
   
2. Test as Participant:
   - Find study
   - Complete study
   - Submit responses
   
3. Fix ONLY what's broken in this flow
4. Ignore all other features temporarily
```

### **Plan D: Ship Something New (3-5 Days)**
Build momentum with a small feature:
```bash
1. Pick ONE feature from requirements
2. That can be completed in 3 days
3. That users will actually notice
4. Build it, test it, ship it
5. Celebrate the win!
```

## 💡 WORKING EFFECTIVELY WITH AI ASSISTANTS

### **Good Prompts (Specific & Clear)**
✅ "The login button on production returns 404. Here's the error: [paste error]"
✅ "Add a 'export to CSV' feature to the analytics dashboard"
✅ "Fix TypeScript error in StudyBuilder.tsx line 145"
✅ "The study creation flow breaks at step 3. Console shows: [error]"

### **Bad Prompts (Too Vague)**
❌ "Fix all the issues"
❌ "Make it better"
❌ "Nothing works"
❌ "Optimize everything"

### **Prompt Template for Bugs**
```
Issue: [Specific feature/page]
Expected: [What should happen]
Actual: [What actually happens]
Error: [Console/Network error if any]
Steps: [How to reproduce]
Environment: Production / Local
```

# Focus on that ONE thing only
```

### **During Development**
```bash
# Work on ONE feature at a time
# Test locally first
# Commit frequently with clear messages
