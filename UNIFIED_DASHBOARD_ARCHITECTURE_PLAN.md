# ResearchHub Unified Dashboard Architecture Plan
*Comprehensive UX redesign for simplified, efficient user experience*

## üéØ Vision: Single Context, Maximum Efficiency

Transform ResearchHub from a **multi-page application** to a **unified workspace** where users accomplish all tasks within focused contexts without constant navigation.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architectural Changes

### 1. **Unified Dashboard + Collaboration Interface**

#### **Current Problem**
```
Dashboard Page (studies overview) ‚Üí Navigate to ‚Üí Collaboration Page (team features)
                ‚Üì Context Lost ‚Üì
User must remember which study they were working on
```

#### **New Solution: Tabbed Unified Interface**
```tsx
<UnifiedWorkspace>
  <StudyContextHeader currentStudy={selectedStudy} />
  <TabNavigation>
    <Tab>Overview</Tab>        // Current dashboard content
    <Tab>Collaboration</Tab>   // Team features in context
    <Tab>Analytics</Tab>       // Study-specific analytics
    <Tab>Templates</Tab>       // Contextual template access
  </TabNavigation>
  <TabContent />
</UnifiedWorkspace>
```

### 2. **Study-Centric Analytics Integration**

#### **Current Problem**
- Analytics live in separate `/analytics` page
- Global analytics mix different studies confusingly
- No quick access to current study metrics

#### **New Solution: Contextual Analytics**
```tsx
// Within Study Context
<StudyWorkspace studyId={currentStudy.id}>
  <QuickMetrics />           // Completion rate, responses, etc.
  <AnalyticsTab>
    <LiveResults />          // Real-time participant responses
    <DetailedAnalytics />    // Advanced charts and insights
    <ComparisonTools />      // Compare with past studies
  </AnalyticsTab>
</StudyWorkspace>
```

### 3. **Admin-Managed Template System**

#### **Current Problem**
- Complex marketplace with community publishing
- Rating/review systems users don't need
- Overwhelming discovery interface

#### **New Solution: Curated Template Library**
```tsx
<AdminTemplateManagement>
  <PreBuiltTemplates />     // Admin-curated, high-quality
  <OrganizationTemplates /> // Private organization templates
  <RecentlyUsed />          // Quick access to personal history
</AdminTemplateManagement>

<SimpleTemplateSelector>
  <CategoryTabs />          // UX Research, Market Research, etc.
  <TemplateGrid />          // Clean, focused selection
  <QuickStart />            // Immediate study creation
</SimpleTemplateSelector>
```
