## 🎯 Summary of Findings

### What's Working ✅
1. Researcher account: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
2. API Layer: All endpoints responding correctly
3. Authentication: JWT tokens working
4. Database: Queries executing successfully
5. Navigation: Role-based routing working

### What's "Broken" ❌
**NONE SO FAR!**

The "errors" in console are from:
- Browser extensions (not our code)
- Ad blocker blocking Sentry (expected, harmless)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### How to Identify Real Errors:
1. **Browser Extension Errors:** File name has `.js` but NOT from your code folder
   - Example: `contentScript.js:139` ← Not your file!
   - Solution: IGNORE these completely

2. **Ad Blocker Blocks:** `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`
   - Meaning: Ad blocker is working (blocking tracking)
   - Impact: Zero (optional tracking only)
   - Solution: IGNORE in development

3. **Real Platform Errors:** Would show:
   - ❌ API calls returning 400/500 status
   - ❌ Authentication failures
   - ❌ "Cannot read property" from YOUR code files
   - ❌ Database connection failures

### Your Platform Shows:
- ✅ All APIs returning 200 (SUCCESS)
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Database queries succeeding
- ✅ Navigation working correctly
- ✅ Validations passing

**Translation: Your code is working!** 🎉
