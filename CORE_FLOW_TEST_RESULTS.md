# 🧪 Core User Flow Test Results
*Tested: August 31, 2025*

## 📊 Test Summary
- **Step 1 (Researcher Login)**: ✅ WORKING
- **Step 2 (Create Study)**: 🔴 BROKEN - Critical Issue
- **Step 3 (Launch Study)**: 🟡 Partially Working  
- **Step 4 (Complete as Participant)**: ❓ Unable to Test

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Block Builder Broken

### Problem Description
The study creation flow completely breaks at the Block Builder step:

1. **Drag & Drop Not Working**: Cannot add blocks from Block Library to Study Flow
2. **Continue Button Disabled**: Cannot progress to Review/Launch steps
3. **Navigation Disabled**: Review and Launch tabs are disabled
4. **No Study Created**: Because flow cannot complete, no studies get saved

### Evidence
- Local Dev: Block builder completely non-functional
- Production: Has existing studies but same issue likely affects new study creation
- Screenshots saved showing disabled Continue button and non-functional drag-drop

### Impact
- **New users cannot create studies** 
- **Platform core functionality is broken**
- **Business critical - blocks user onboarding**

## ✅ What IS Working

### Authentication (100% Working)
- Login/logout functions properly
- Session management works
- Dashboard loads correctly
- Navigation between app sections works

### Existing Studies (Production)
- Production has 2 active studies:
  - "Researcher Test Study" - 10 participants, 85% completion
  - "Test New Application Study" - 5 participants, 85% completion
- Studies show proper status and metrics

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Debug Block Builder component**
   - Check drag-drop event handlers
   - Verify state management for study flow
   - Test block addition functionality

2. **Test Local vs Production**
   - Compare Block Builder between environments
   - Check for environment-specific issues
   - Verify API endpoints are working

### Priority Actions
1. Fix drag-drop functionality in Block Builder
2. Ensure Continue button enables when blocks are added
3. Test complete study creation flow end-to-end
4. Add participant access URL testing

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Focus ALL effort on fixing Block Builder
2. This is the #1 blocker for platform usability
3. Once fixed, re-test complete user flow
4. Then focus on participant access patterns

## 📱 Test Environment Details
- **Local**: http://localhost:5175 (has npm run dev:fullstack running)
- **Production**: https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app
- **Test Account**: abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com / Testtest123

*This is the most critical issue blocking platform usability. All other work should be paused until Block Builder is functional.*
