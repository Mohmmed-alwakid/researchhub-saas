## 💡 **Actionable Improvements for ResearchHub**

### **1. Enhanced Template Categories**

**Current ResearchHub**: Generic template browsing  
**Maze Approach**: Clear categorization (Usability Testing, Content Testing, Feedback Survey)  
**Improvement**: Add specific categories to our templates:

```typescript
// Suggested template categories for ResearchHub
const TEMPLATE_CATEGORIES = {
  'usability-testing': 'Usability Testing',
  'content-testing': 'Content Testing', 
  'feedback-survey': 'Feedback Survey',
  'user-interviews': 'User Interviews',
  'concept-validation': 'Concept Validation'
};
```

### **2. Variable Placeholder System**

**Current ResearchHub**: Static template text  
**Maze Approach**: [Product], [Feature] placeholders for customization  
**Improvement**: Implement dynamic variable replacement:

```typescript
// Example template with variables
const template = {
  title: "Usability Testing for [PRODUCT]",
  blocks: [
    {
      type: 'yes_no',
      question: "Have you used [PRODUCT] before?",
      variables: ['PRODUCT']
    },
    {
      type: 'opinion_scale', 
      question: "How easy to use is [FEATURE]?",
      variables: ['FEATURE']
    }
  ]
};
```

### **3. Improved Template Descriptions**

**Current ResearchHub**: Basic template information  
**Maze Approach**: Detailed use case explanations with benefits  
**Improvement**: Enhanced template descriptions:

```typescript
const templateDescriptions = {
  'usability-testing-new-product': {
    title: 'Usability Testing a New Product',
    category: 'Usability Testing',
    description: 'Validate usability across your wireframes and prototypes with real users early on. Use this pre-built template to capture valuable feedback on accessibility and user experience so you can see what\'s working (and what isn\'t).',
    estimatedTime: '10-15 minutes',
    participantCount: '15-30 users',
    insights: ['User behavior patterns', 'Pain points identification', 'Feature effectiveness']
  }
};
```

### **4. Simplified Study Type Selection**

**Current ResearchHub**: Complex study type modal  
**Maze Approach**: Simple binary choice (Unmoderated vs Moderated)  
**Improvement**: Streamline our study type selection:

```typescript
const STUDY_TYPES = [
  {
    id: 'unmoderated',
    name: 'Unmoderated Study', 
    description: 'Set up surveys and usability tests for prototypes, websites, and apps.',
    icon: 'Users',
    recommended: true
  },
  {
    id: 'moderated', 
    name: 'Moderated Session',
    description: 'Schedule and run interviews, then turn insights into actionable data.',
    icon: 'Video'
  }
];
```

### **5. Enhanced Block Descriptions**

**Current ResearchHub**: Basic block names  
**Maze Approach**: Clear, action-oriented descriptions  
**Improvement**: Update our block library descriptions:

```typescript
const ENHANCED_BLOCK_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  'five_second_test': 'First Impression Testing - Show your design for 5 seconds and gather immediate feedback',
  'opinion_scale': 'Rating & Satisfaction - Collect quantitative feedback on user satisfaction and preferences',
  'open_question': 'Qualitative Insights - Gather detailed feedback and understand user motivations',
  'yes_no': 'Quick Decisions - Get binary feedback on specific features or concepts',
  'prototype_test': 'Interactive Testing - Test real user interactions with your designs and prototypes'
};
```
