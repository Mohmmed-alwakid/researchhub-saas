/*
EXPECTED BEHAVIORS:

1. When typing StudyBuilderBlock interface:
   - Should suggest: id, type, order, title, description, settings
   - Should know BlockType has 13 options

2. When typing API handler:
   - Should suggest: const { action } = req.query
   - Should suggest: switch (action) pattern
   - Should suggest: authenticateUser patterns

3. When typing Supabase queries:
   - Should suggest: .eq('researcher_id', userId) for RLS
   - Should understand study ownership patterns

4. When creating new files:
   - Should suggest proper locations (testing/, not tests/)
   - Should warn about API function limits

5. General ResearchHub awareness:
   - Should know about 13-block system
   - Should understand study creation workflows
   - Should enforce designated test accounts
