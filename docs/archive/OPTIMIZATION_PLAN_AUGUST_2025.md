## 📊 **WEEK 1-2: PERFORMANCE & DATABASE OPTIMIZATION**

### **🔧 Performance Analysis & Improvements**

#### **Day 1-3: Baseline Performance Audit**
```bash
# Establish current performance metrics
npm run test:performance          # Lighthouse audit
npm run test:api-performance     # API response times  
npm run test:database-performance # Database query analysis
```

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- Page load times (target: <3 seconds)
- API response times (target: <500ms)
- Database query performance (target: <200ms)
- Bundle size optimization (target: <1MB initial load)

#### **Day 4-7: Database Optimization**
```bash
# Database performance improvements
1. Add database indexing for frequently queried fields
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Optimize Supabase queries with proper joins
4. Add database caching layer
```

**Specific Optimizations:**
- **Studies Table**: Index on `creator_id`, `status`, `created_at`
- **Applications Table**: Index on `study_id`, `user_id`, `status`
- **Users Table**: Index on `email`, `role`, `created_at`
- **Query Optimization**: Replace N+1 queries with proper joins

#### **Day 8-14: Frontend Performance**
```bash
# Frontend optimization tasks
1. Code splitting and lazy loading
2. Image optimization and lazy loading  
3. Bundle size reduction
4. Memory leak detection and fixes
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
- Optimize image assets with WebP format
- Tree shaking for unused dependencies
- Virtual scrolling for large data lists
