mv COMPLETE_UI_UX_IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS_REPORT.md product-manager/archive/achievements/
mv COLLABORATION_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md product-manager/archive/achievements/
mv AFKAR_REBRAND_COMPLETE_SUCCESS_REPORT.md product-manager/archive/achievements/
```

### Step 2: Extract Requirements from Documentation
**Target Folder**: `/product-manager/requirements/historical/`

```bash
# Create historical requirements folder
mkdir product-manager/requirements/historical

# Extract and move requirements documents
mv COMPREHENSIVE_STUDY_CREATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md product-manager/requirements/historical/
mv COMPREHENSIVE_UI_UX_TESTING_PLAN.md product-manager/requirements/historical/
```

### Step 3: Archive Development Scripts
**Target Folder**: `/archive/scripts/`

```bash
# Create scripts archive
mkdir archive/scripts

# Move migration and check scripts
mv apply-*.js archive/scripts/
mv check-*.js archive/scripts/
mv create-*.js archive/scripts/
```

mv auth-*.html testing/
```

### Step 5: Archive Experimental/Outdated
**Target Folder**: `/archive/deprecated/`

```bash
