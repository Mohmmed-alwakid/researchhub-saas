# üìã REQUIREMENT: Block Session Rendering System

**Date Created**: June 29, 2025  
**Status**: üü¢ Approved  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

---

## üéØ BUSINESS CONTEXT

### Problem Statement
**What problem are we solving?**
- Participants cannot currently complete studies because block session rendering is not implemented
- Researchers can create studies but cannot collect actual participant responses
- Core product value proposition (user testing) is not functional for end users
- Revenue generation is blocked until participants can complete studies

### Target Users
**Who will benefit from this feature?**
- **Primary**: Participants completing studies
- **Secondary**: Researchers collecting study data
- **Business Impact**: Enables core revenue-generating functionality

### Business Value
**Why is this important?**
- **Critical Path**: Required for core product functionality
- **Revenue Enablement**: Participants completing studies = billable usage
- **User Satisfaction**: Complete user journey from study creation to data collection
- **Competitive Parity**: Basic expectation for user testing platforms

## üîç FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### User Stories
**As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]**

1. **Story 1**: As a participant, I want to view and interact with study blocks so that I can provide feedback to researchers
2. **Story 2**: As a participant, I want to see my progress through a study so that I understand how much remains
3. **Story 3**: As a participant, I want my responses to be saved so that my data is not lost if I leave the session
4. **Story 4**: As a researcher, I want to view participant responses so that I can analyze study results
5. **Story 5**: As a researcher, I want to see study completion rates so that I can measure engagement

### Acceptance Criteria
**How do we know it's done?**

- [ ] All 13 block types render correctly for participants
- [ ] Participants can navigate through study blocks sequentially
- [ ] All response data is saved to the database
- [ ] Progress tracking shows completion percentage
- [ ] Session management handles interruptions and resumption
- [ ] Researchers can view collected responses in dashboard
- [ ] Study completion triggers appropriate notifications

### Use Cases
**Detailed scenarios of how the feature will be used**

#### Use Case 1: Complete Study Session
- **Preconditions**: Participant is logged in and has access to a published study
- **Steps**: 
  1. Participant clicks "Start Study" from available studies
  2. System loads first block (typically Welcome Screen)
  3. Participant reads content and clicks "Continue"
  4. System progresses through blocks sequentially
  5. For each block, participant provides required input
  6. System saves responses after each block completion
  7. Progress indicator updates with each block
  8. Final block (Thank You) displays completion message
- **Expected Result**: Complete study session with all responses saved
- **Alternative Flows**: Participant can pause and resume later

## üé® USER EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS

### User Interface
**How should it look and feel?**
- Clean, focused interface showing one block at a time
- Clear progress indicator at top of screen
- Consistent navigation (Next/Previous buttons)
- Mobile-responsive design for various devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### User Flow
**How users navigate through the feature**
- **Entry Point**: "Start Study" button from participant dashboard
- **Block Sequence**: Linear progression through study blocks
- **Response Collection**: Each block collects specific data type
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicator of completion percentage
- **Exit Points**: Study completion or "Save & Exit" option

## ‚öôÔ∏è TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### System Integration
**How does this connect to existing systems?**
- **Database Schema**: 
  - `study_sessions` table for session management
  - `study_responses` table for response data
  - Foreign key relationships to studies and users
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/study-sessions/start` - Begin new session
  - `PUT /api/study-sessions/{id}/response` - Save block response
  - `GET /api/study-sessions/{id}` - Resume existing session
  - `POST /api/study-sessions/{id}/complete` - Mark session complete
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation for participant access

### Block Type Implementation
**Each block type needs participant rendering:**

1. **Welcome Screen**: Static content display with continue button
2. **Open Question**: Textarea input with character limits
3. **Opinion Scale**: Interactive rating scales (1-10, stars, emotions)
4. **Simple Input**: Form inputs (text, number, date, email) with validation
5. **Multiple Choice**: Radio buttons or checkboxes with custom options
6. **Context Screen**: Informational content with navigation
7. **Yes/No**: Binary choice with visual feedback
8. **5-Second Test**: Timed image display with recall questions
9. **Card Sort**: Drag-and-drop categorization interface
10. **Tree Test**: Navigation testing with clickable hierarchy
11. **Thank You**: Completion message with study summary
12. **Image Upload**: File upload interface with preview
13. **File Upload**: Document upload with file type validation

### Performance Requirements
**How fast and reliable should it be?**
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for block transitions
- **Data Persistence**: Auto-save after each block completion
- **Offline Capability**: Basic offline support for response storage
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Support 100+ simultaneous participants

---

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Test Scenarios
**What needs to be tested?**
- **Happy Path**: Complete study from start to finish
- **Interruption**: Pause and resume study session
- **Validation**: Invalid inputs handled gracefully
- **Performance**: Large studies with many blocks
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- **Mobile**: Responsive design on various screen sizes

### Quality Assurance
**How do we ensure quality?**
- **Manual Testing**: Use provided test accounts for end-to-end testing
- **Data Validation**: Verify all responses saved correctly
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for network issues
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation testing
