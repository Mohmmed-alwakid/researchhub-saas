# 📚 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - DOCUMENTATION HIERARCHY
## Information Centralization Strategy - Implemented July 12, 2025

---

## 🎯 CENTRALIZATION PRINCIPLE

**RULE #1: `docs/requirements/` = THE ONLY AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE**

All system specifications, architecture decisions, and implementation details are defined EXCLUSIVELY in the requirements folder. Any information found elsewhere is either:
- Implementation notes (non-authoritative)
- Status updates (temporal)
- Archived content (historical)

---

## 📁 AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

### **PRIMARY SOURCE (AUTHORITATIVE)**
```
docs/requirements/
├── 01-PLATFORM_FOUNDATION.md           ← System architecture & tech stack
├── 02-AUTHENTICATION_SYSTEM.md         ← User auth & security
├── 03-USER_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.md        ← User roles & permissions  
├── 04-STUDY_CREATION_SYSTEM.md         ← Study creation workflows
├── 05-PARTICIPANT_EXPERIENCE.md        ← Participant journey & UI
├── 06-ADMIN_DASHBOARD_SYSTEM.md        ← Admin tools & management
├── 07-TEMPLATE_LIBRARY_SYSTEM.md       ← Template system & marketplace
├── 08-ANALYTICS_BUSINESS_INTELLIGENCE.md ← Analytics & reporting
├── 09-INTEGRATIONS_API_ECOSYSTEM.md    ← External integrations
├── 10-BILLING_PAYMENT_SYSTEM.md        ← Payment processing
├── 11-COMMUNICATION_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md ← Messaging & notifications
├── 12-DEPLOYMENT_INFRASTRUCTURE.md     ← Hosting & deployment
└── 13-API_DOCUMENTATION_DEVELOPER_RESOURCES.md ← API docs
```

### **SECONDARY SOURCES (NON-AUTHORITATIVE)**
```
docs/reports/           ← Implementation progress reports
docs/implementation/    ← Technical implementation notes  
testing/               ← Test specifications & results
archive/               ← Historical documentation
Root *.md files        ← Status updates & guides
```

---

## 🚨 CONFLICT RESOLUTION RULES

### **When Information Conflicts:**
1. **Requirements win** - `docs/requirements/` is always correct
2. **Update secondary sources** - Make reports/implementation match requirements
3. **Archive conflicting content** - Move outdated info to `archive/`
4. **Never contradict requirements** - Update requirements first, then implementation

### **Information Hierarchy:**
```
1. docs/requirements/     ← TRUTH (What we're building)
2. docs/implementation/   ← NOTES (How we're building it)
3. docs/reports/         ← STATUS (What we've built so far)
4. testing/              ← VALIDATION (Proof it works)
5. Everything else       ← CONTEXT (Background information)
```

---

## 🎯 USAGE GUIDELINES

### **For AI Agents & Developers:**
- **Always check requirements FIRST** before consulting other documentation
- **When requirements are unclear** - Update requirements, don't create parallel docs
- **When implementation differs from requirements** - Fix implementation or update requirements
- **When creating new features** - Add to requirements first, implement second

### **For Documentation Updates:**
- **New features** → Add to appropriate requirements document
- **Implementation details** → Update implementation notes (reference requirements)
- **Bug fixes** → Update requirements if behavior changes
- **Status updates** → Use reports folder (temporary documentation)

### **For Information Queries:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Start with requirements
"How does study creation work?" → Check docs/requirements/04-STUDY_CREATION_SYSTEM.md

# ❌ INCORRECT: Start with scattered sources  
"How does study creation work?" → Search all docs and find 5 different answers
```

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### **Phase 1: Establish Hierarchy ✅**
- [x] Rename requirements-new to requirements
- [x] Create single source of truth documentation
- [x] Establish conflict resolution rules

### **Phase 2: Audit & Clean ⏳**
- [ ] Compare requirements vs implementation reports
- [ ] Identify and resolve contradictions  
- [ ] Archive outdated/conflicting documentation
- [ ] Update all cross-references

### **Phase 3: Enforce Standards ⏳**
- [ ] Update all tooling to reference requirements first
- [ ] Create validation scripts to check consistency
- [ ] Establish documentation review process
- [ ] Train team on single source principle

---

## 🔄 MAINTENANCE PROCESS

### **Weekly Documentation Review:**
1. **Check for conflicts** between requirements and implementation
2. **Update requirements** if system behavior has changed
3. **Archive old reports** that are no longer relevant
4. **Validate cross-references** are pointing to authoritative sources

### **Before Major Changes:**
1. **Update requirements FIRST** with planned changes
2. **Review dependencies** across all requirements documents  
3. **Plan implementation** based on updated requirements
4. **Test against requirements** not against old implementations

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**Information Centralization Success:**
- ✅ Single answer to "How does X work?" questions
- ✅ No contradictions between docs and implementation
- ✅ New team members find information in requirements first
- ✅ Implementation matches requirements 100%

**Documentation Quality:**
- ✅ Requirements are complete and unambiguous
- ✅ Implementation notes reference requirements
- ✅ Reports show progress against requirements
- ✅ Tests validate requirements compliance

---

## 🚀 BENEFITS ACHIEVED

1. **Eliminated Information Chaos** - No more conflicting documentation
2. **Accelerated Development** - Developers know where to find truth
3. **Improved Quality** - Implementation matches specifications
4. **Better AI Integration** - AI agents have single authoritative source
5. **Reduced Confusion** - Team alignment on system design
