# 🎯 RESEARCHHUB REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM
## 📚 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENTATION

**Created**: July 12, 2025  
**Status**: 🟢 AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE - IMPLEMENTATION READY  
**Approach**: Following `FOCUSED_STUDY_CREATION_REQUIREMENTS.md` excellence standard  
**Philosophy**: Zero-ambiguity, AI-agent ready, production-grade specifications

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: THIS IS THE ONLY AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE

**ALL system specifications, architecture decisions, and implementation details are defined EXCLUSIVELY in this folder.**

Any information found elsewhere in the project is either:
- Implementation notes (non-authoritative)
- Status updates (temporal)
- Archived content (historical)

**When in doubt, THIS folder contains the truth.**
