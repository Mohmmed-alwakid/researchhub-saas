# üìã STORY ID & ORGANIZATION BEST PRACTICES

> **Comprehensive Guide for Requirements Management & Story Organization**

## üéØ **STORY ID SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

### **Problem Solved**
The previous system had duplicate story IDs (multiple "Story 1.1", "Story 1.2") across different files, making cross-references impossible and causing confusion.

### **New Unique ID System**
```
Format: [PREFIX]-[NUMBER]
Examples:
- UE-001: User Research Engine Story #1
- PM-047: Participant Management Story #47  
- SE-023: Study Execution Story #23
- AI-012: Analytics & Insights Story #12
```

### **Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Globally Unique**: No duplicate IDs across the entire project
- ‚úÖ **Traceable**: Easy to find stories and their dependencies  
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Can support 999 stories per feature area
- ‚úÖ **Intuitive**: Prefix immediately identifies feature area
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Referenceable**: Stories can link to each other clearly

## üìÇ **FOLDER ORGANIZATION STRATEGY**

### **Feature-Based Primary Organization** ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED**
```
docs/requirements/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-platform/           # UE, PM, SE stories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics-insights/      # AI stories  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ enterprise/             # EF, IA stories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-experience/        # ME stories
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ business/              # MB stories
```

**Why Feature-Based?**
- Stories naturally group by technical implementation
- Features often span multiple user roles
- Easier for development teams to find related work
- Aligns with sprint planning and epic organization

### **Role-Based Cross-Reference** ‚úÖ **SECONDARY**
```
docs/requirements/user-stories/by-role/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ researcher/     # Index of all researcher-relevant stories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ participant/    # Index of all participant-relevant stories  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/         # Index of all admin-relevant stories
```

**Why Cross-Reference?**
- Product managers can see all stories for specific user roles
- UX designers can understand complete user journeys
- Stakeholders can review features by user perspective
- Business requirements can be mapped to user needs

## üèóÔ∏è **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Update Story IDs (Immediate)**
1. **Update Current Files**: Change all story IDs to new format
2. **Create Story Registry**: Add table to 00_MASTER_INDEX.md
3. **Update Cross-References**: Fix all story links between files
4. **Validate Uniqueness**: Ensure no duplicate IDs

### **Phase 2: Reorganize Files (Next)**
1. **Move Files to Feature Folders**: Organize by feature area
2. **Create Role Indexes**: Build cross-reference files by role
3. **Update Navigation**: Fix all internal links
4. **Create Priority Views**: Organize stories by P0/P1/P2

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Organization (Future)**
1. **Epic Tracking**: Link stories to high-level epics
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Visual dependency graphs
3. **Sprint Integration**: Connect to development sprints  
4. **Automated Validation**: Tools to ensure ID uniqueness
