## 🎯 Feature 1: Block Insertion Points

### What Are Insertion Points?

Block Insertion Points allow you to place new blocks at **exactly** the right position in your study flow. Instead of adding blocks only at the end, you can now insert them between any existing blocks with precision.

### How to Use Insertion Points

#### **Step 1: Navigate to Study Builder**
1. Go to **Studies** → **Create New Study**
2. Choose your study type and template (or start from scratch)
3. Navigate to the **Block Configuration** step

#### **Step 2: Activate Insertion Points**
1. **Hover** between any two blocks in your study flow
2. Watch for the **insertion zone** to appear with a subtle gradient line
3. Look for the **"+ Add Block Here"** button that appears on hover

#### **Step 3: Insert Blocks**
1. **Click** the "+" button where you want to insert a new block
2. **Select** the block type from the library that opens
3. **Confirm** - the new block will be inserted at that exact position

### Visual Guide

```
Block 1: Welcome Screen
    ↓
  [+ Add Block Here] ← Insertion Point (appears on hover)
    ↓
Block 2: Survey Question
    ↓
  [+ Add Block Here] ← Insertion Point (appears on hover)
    ↓
Block 3: Thank You Screen
```

### Key Benefits

- **🎯 Precise Placement**: Insert blocks exactly where needed
- **🔄 Flexible Workflow**: Reorganize study flow without starting over
- **⚡ Quick Insertion**: No need to drag-and-drop or complex menus
- **👀 Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of where blocks will be placed

### Tips & Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Use insertion points to add follow-up questions after specific blocks
- Insert instruction screens before complex tasks
- Add breaks or context screens between different study sections

❌ **DON'T:**
- Try to insert before the Welcome screen (this is fixed as the first block)
- Insert after the Thank You screen (this is fixed as the last block)

## ⚡ Feature 2: Quick Actions

### What Are Quick Actions?

Quick Actions provide instant access to common block management tasks without opening complex menus. These actions appear when you hover over any block in your study flow.

### Available Quick Actions

#### **1. 📋 Duplicate Block**
- **Function**: Creates an exact copy of the selected block
- **Location**: Appears as "📋" icon on block hover
- **Result**: New block titled "[Original Title] (Copy)" inserted after original

#### **2. ⬆️ Move Up**
- **Function**: Moves the block one position earlier in the flow
- **Location**: Appears as "⬆️" icon on block hover
- **Disabled**: When block is already at the top (after Welcome screen)

#### **3. ⬇️ Move Down**
- **Function**: Moves the block one position later in the flow
- **Location**: Appears as "⬇️" icon on block hover
- **Disabled**: When block is already at the bottom (before Thank You screen)

#### **4. 🗑️ Delete Block**
- **Function**: Removes the block from the study flow
- **Location**: Appears as "🗑️" icon on block hover
- **Protection**: Cannot delete Welcome or Thank You screens

### How to Use Quick Actions

#### **Step 1: Hover Over Block**
1. Move your mouse cursor over any block in your study flow
2. Wait for the **quick action buttons** to appear (usually within 0.5 seconds)
3. Buttons will appear in the top-right corner of the block

#### **Step 2: Select Action**
1. **Click** the desired action button
2. **Confirm** any deletion actions if prompted
3. **Review** the updated study flow

### Visual Reference

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Block Title: Survey Question            │ ⬆️ ⬇️ 📋 🗑️
│ Description: Rate your experience...    │ ← Quick Actions
│ Type: Opinion Scale                     │   (appear on hover)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Advanced Usage Tips

#### **Efficient Block Duplication**
1. Create a complex block with multiple settings
2. Use **📋 Duplicate** to copy it
3. Edit the duplicate for similar but different content
4. Saves time on complex configurations

#### **Quick Reordering**
1. Use **⬆️ Move Up** and **⬇️ Move Down** for fine-tuning block order
2. Much faster than drag-and-drop for small adjustments
3. Maintains all block settings and configurations

#### **Safe Deletion**
1. **🗑️ Delete** removes blocks instantly
2. Use **📋 Duplicate** first if you might want the block back
3. System blocks (Welcome/Thank You) are protected from deletion

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Insertion Points Not Appearing**
- **Cause**: Hover state not detected
- **Solution**: Ensure mouse cursor is between blocks, wait 0.5 seconds
- **Alternative**: Use standard "Add Block" button if needed

#### **Quick Actions Not Working**
- **Cause**: Block may be system-protected (Welcome/Thank You)
- **Solution**: Quick actions are disabled for system blocks by design
- **Workaround**: Use block library to add new blocks instead

#### **Search Not Finding Blocks**
- **Cause**: Search term may be too specific
- **Solution**: Try broader terms or use category filters
- **Tip**: Search works on both names and descriptions

#### **Performance Issues**
- **Cause**: Browser may be low on memory
- **Solution**: Refresh page, close unnecessary tabs
- **Prevention**: Use latest browser version for best performance
