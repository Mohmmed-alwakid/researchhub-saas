7. yes/no
Description: The Yes/No question type allows researchers to pose a closed-ended question to participants, where they can choose between two options: Yes or No. This question type is useful for measuring preferences, opinions, or binary decisions.
Components:
Question *
Notes
An optional section where researchers can add additional instructions or context to clarify the question.
Example: "Consider all the features you use when answering."

Type
Icons: Use simple icons (e.g., checkmark and cross) to represent Yes and No.
Emotions: Use expressive emojis or images (e.g., ðŸ˜Š for Yes, ðŸ˜ž for No) to represent the options, adding an emotional dimension to the response.

8. 5-Second Test
Description: The 5-Second Test is designed to quickly gauge a participant's initial impressions and memory of an image. Participants view an image for a limited time and are then asked to recall or describe their immediate thoughts and observations.
Components:
Toggle Switch:
Customize Instructions: Researchers can enable or disable customized instructions. When enabled, the default instruction is: "Focus on the image. You will view an image for a limited time. Try to understand what the image is about and remember as much information as you can."
