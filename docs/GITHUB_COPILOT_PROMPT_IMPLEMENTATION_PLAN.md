# GitHub Copilot Prompt Files Implementation Plan
## ResearchHub SaaS Platform Enhancement

**Created:** September 27, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks (20 working days)  
**Owner:** Development Team  

---

## üéØ Project Overview

### **Objective**
Implement a comprehensive GitHub Copilot prompt file system for ResearchHub that enhances AI-assisted development workflows, improves code suggestion quality, and accelerates development velocity while maintaining architectural constraints.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Development Speed**: 30-50% faster component and API creation
- **Code Quality**: Better adherence to ResearchHub patterns and conventions
- **Team Productivity**: Consistent code generation across all developers
- **Onboarding**: Faster new developer integration with context-aware suggestions

### **Critical Constraints**
- **12 API Function Limit**: Must respect Vercel's function limitations
- **ResearchHub Architecture**: Follow study-centric, block-based design patterns
- **Performance**: No impact on Copilot response times
- **Team Adoption**: Must be intuitive and provide immediate value
