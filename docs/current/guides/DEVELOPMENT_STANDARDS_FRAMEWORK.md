# ResearchHub Development Standards & Requirements Framework

**Created**: June 28, 2025  
**Status**: üö® MANDATORY - All Future Development Must Follow These Standards

## üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

### 1. **NEVER CREATE NEW WHEN OLD EXISTS**
- **Rule**: Always check for existing implementations before creating new ones
- **Process**: Search, analyze, extend/improve existing code
- **Example**: Study creation already existed - should have enhanced, not replaced
- **Enforcement**: All PRs must include "Existing Code Analysis" section

### 2. **REQUIREMENTS-FIRST DEVELOPMENT** 
- **Rule**: No coding without detailed requirements document
- **Process**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing
- **Documentation**: Every feature must have requirements.md file
- **Validation**: Requirements must be approved before any code is written

### 3. **CONSISTENT OUTPUT GUARANTEE**
- **Rule**: Same requirements = Same output, always
- **Process**: Requirements act as source of truth for consistency
- **Version Control**: Requirements are versioned and tracked
- **Quality**: Reproducible, predictable development outcomes

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## 7. TESTING STRATEGY
### Unit Tests
- Component testing approach
- Coverage requirements

### Integration Tests
- API testing
- E2E scenarios

### Manual Testing
- Test cases
- User acceptance testing

## 8. ROLLOUT PLAN
### Development Environment
- Local testing steps
- Development deployment

### Staging
- Staging deployment
- QA testing process

### Production
- Production deployment plan
- Rollback strategy
- Monitoring plan
```

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
1. **Create requirements document** using template above
2. **Existing code audit** - catalog what already exists
3. **Stakeholder review** - get approval before coding
4. **Technical design** - architecture and integration plan

### Step 2: Design Phase
1. **UI/UX mockups** if applicable
2. **Technical architecture** diagram
3. **API specifications** if needed
4. **Database schema** changes if required

### Step 3: Implementation
1. **Follow requirements exactly** - no scope creep
2. **Extend existing code** when possible
3. **Test incrementally** during development
4. **Document changes** in real-time

### Step 4: Testing & QA
1. **Unit tests** for all new functionality
2. **Integration tests** for system interaction
3. **Manual testing** against requirements
4. **Performance validation** 

### Step 5: Documentation & Handoff
1. **Update technical documentation**
2. **Create user guides** if needed
3. **Knowledge transfer** to team
4. **Production deployment** checklist

## üéØ RESEARCHHUB SPECIFIC STANDARDS

### Study Builder System Standards
```markdown
# Study Builder Enhancement Requirements Template

## Current System Analysis
- [ ] Audit existing StudyCreationWizard
- [ ] Map current study creation flow
- [ ] Identify reusable components
- [ ] Document current state management

## Enhancement Approach
- [ ] Extend existing wizard steps
- [ ] Add new props/functionality
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility
- [ ] Preserve existing user flows

## Implementation Guidelines
- [ ] Use existing StepProps interface
- [ ] Follow current naming conventions
- [ ] Maintain TypeScript safety
- [ ] Preserve routing structure
```

### Database/Backend Standards
```markdown
# Backend Enhancement Requirements Template

```

---

## üîç PRE-DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

### Before Any Coding:
- [ ] **Requirements document created and approved**
- [ ] **Existing code analysis completed**
- [ ] **Technical design reviewed**
- [ ] **Integration plan documented**
- [ ] **Testing strategy defined**
- [ ] **Performance requirements set**
- [ ] **Timeline and milestones agreed**

### During Development:
- [ ] **Follow requirements exactly**
- [ ] **Extend, don't replace existing code**
- [ ] **Test incrementally**
- [ ] **Document as you go**
- [ ] **Regular stakeholder updates**

### Post-Development:
- [ ] **Requirements validation complete**
- [ ] **All tests passing**
- [ ] **Documentation updated**
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks met**
- [ ] **Production deployment ready**

## üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### 1. **Replacement Instead of Enhancement**
- ‚ùå Creating new StudyBuilder instead of improving existing
- ‚ùå Building parallel systems
- ‚ùå Ignoring existing code patterns

### 2. **Requirements Drift**
- ‚ùå Starting to code without clear requirements
- ‚ùå Adding features not in requirements
- ‚ùå Changing requirements mid-development

### 3. **Inconsistent Implementation**
- ‚ùå Different output for same requirements
- ‚ùå Not following established patterns
- ‚ùå Breaking existing functionality

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS METRICS

### Development Quality
- **100% requirements coverage** - all requirements implemented
- **Zero regression bugs** - existing functionality preserved
- **Consistent output** - same requirements = same results
- **Performance maintained** - no degradation in speed/UX

### Process Adherence
- **Requirements-first approach** - no coding without requirements
- **Existing code reuse** - extension over replacement
- **Documentation completeness** - all changes documented
- **Testing coverage** - comprehensive test suite

---

## üéØ RESEARCHHUB ENFORCEMENT

### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] Requirements document reference
- [ ] Existing code analysis included
- [ ] Testing coverage report
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Quality Gates
1. **Requirements Gate** - approved requirements before coding
2. **Design Gate** - technical design review
3. **Implementation Gate** - code review with quality metrics
4. **Testing Gate** - all tests passing with coverage
5. **Documentation Gate** - complete documentation update

**This framework ensures consistent, high-quality development that builds upon existing work rather than replacing it.**
