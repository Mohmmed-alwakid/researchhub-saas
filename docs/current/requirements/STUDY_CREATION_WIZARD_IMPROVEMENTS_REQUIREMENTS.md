## 4. DATA REQUIREMENTS

### Form Data Structure
```typescript
interface EnhancedStudyFormData extends StudyFormData {
  // Add metadata for improved tracking
  draft_id?: string;
  created_at?: string;
  updated_at?: string;
  validation_status?: 'valid' | 'invalid' | 'pending';
  completion_percentage?: number;
}
```

### Auto-Save Structure
```typescript
interface StudyDraft {
  id: string;
  formData: EnhancedStudyFormData;
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: number[];
  validationErrors: Record<string, string>;
  timestamp: number;
  version: string;
}
```

## 5. INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### Component Dependencies

- Maintain backward compatibility with current StepProps interface
- Integrate with existing template system
- Work with current authentication and routing

### API Requirements
- Auto-save endpoint for draft persistence
- Draft recovery endpoint
- Validation endpoint for server-side validation
- Progress tracking for analytics
