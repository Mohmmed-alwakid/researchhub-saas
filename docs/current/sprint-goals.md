## 🚧 **CURRENT BLOCKERS & IMPEDIMENTS**

### **Resolved**
- ✅ Documentation sprawl causing confusion and inefficiency
- ✅ Lack of organized project structure

### **Active Blockers**
- 🔴 **Vercel Function Limit**: 12/12 functions used (need consolidation strategy)
- 🟡 **Technical Debt**: Need comprehensive assessment and prioritization
- 🟡 **Testing Automation**: CI/CD pipeline needs quality gate implementation

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Function Consolidation**: Identify related endpoints for merging
2. **Technical Debt Tracking**: Use structured backlog with impact scoring
3. **Quality Gates**: Implement automated testing and code coverage
