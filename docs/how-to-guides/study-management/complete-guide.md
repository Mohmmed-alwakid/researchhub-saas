# üìä Study Management Guide

## Overview

This guide covers all aspects of managing studies in ResearchHub, from creation to completion, including advanced features and best practices.

## Study Lifecycle

### 1. Planning Phase

**Define Research Objectives**

Before creating your study, clearly define:

- **Primary Research Question**: What do you want to learn?
- **Target Audience**: Who are your ideal participants?
- **Success Metrics**: How will you measure success?
- **Timeline**: When do you need results?

**Example Planning Template:**
```
Research Question: How do users navigate our mobile app's checkout process?
Target Audience: Existing customers aged 25-45 who use mobile devices
Success Metrics: Identify 3+ usability issues and improvement opportunities
Timeline: 2 weeks for data collection, 1 week for analysis
```

### 2. Study Creation

**Choose Study Type**

- **Unmoderated Studies**: Participants complete independently
- **Moderated Interviews**: Live sessions with researcher guidance
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different versions or approaches

**Select Creation Method**

- **Templates**: Use pre-built study structures for common research types
- **From Scratch**: Build completely custom studies

### 3. Study Configuration

**Basic Settings**
```
Title: Clear, descriptive study name
Description: Brief explanation of purpose and what participants will do
Estimated Duration: Realistic time estimate (test with pilot participants)
Study Type: Unmoderated/Moderated
Target Responses: Desired number of participants
```

**Advanced Settings**
- **Participant Screening**: Define inclusion/exclusion criteria
- **Randomization**: Randomize block order for unbiased results
- **Device Restrictions**: Limit to specific device types if needed
- **Geographic Targeting**: Target specific regions or countries

### 4. Block Design

**Block Sequencing Strategy**

1. **Welcome Block**: Set expectations and build rapport
2. **Screening Questions**: Filter appropriate participants
3. **Context Setting**: Provide necessary background information
4. **Main Research Questions**: Core data collection
5. **Follow-up Questions**: Dig deeper into interesting responses
6. **Demographics**: Collect participant background (optional)
7. **Thank You Block**: Show appreciation and next steps

**Block Type Selection Guide**

| Research Goal | Recommended Block Type | Best Practices |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Gather detailed feedback | Open Question | Use specific prompts, limit character count |
| Measure satisfaction | Opinion Scale | Use 5-point or 10-point scales consistently |
| Test preferences | Multiple Choice | Limit to 5-7 options, allow "Other" |
| Collect quick responses | Yes/No | Use for binary decisions only |
| Test first impressions | 5-Second Test | Show stimulus for exactly 5 seconds |
| Understand mental models | Card Sort | Use 15-30 items, clear categories |
| Test navigation | Tree Test | Use realistic task scenarios |

### 5. Study Publishing

## Data Collection Best Practices

### Maximizing Response Quality

**Question Design Principles**

1. **One Concept Per Question**: Avoid double-barreled questions
2. **Neutral Wording**: Avoid leading or biased language
3. **Clear Instructions**: Explain exactly what you want
4. **Appropriate Length**: Match question complexity to response format

**Examples:**

‚ùå **Poor**: "How satisfied are you with our fast and reliable service?"
‚úÖ **Good**: "How satisfied are you with our service speed?" (separate question for reliability)

‚ùå **Poor**: "What do you think about the design?"
‚úÖ **Good**: "What aspects of the design work well for your needs?"

### Monitoring Data Collection

**Real-Time Monitoring**

Check your study dashboard regularly for:
- **Response Count**: Track progress toward target
- **Completion Rate**: Identify potential issues if low
- **Time to Complete**: Verify duration estimates are accurate
- **Drop-off Points**: See where participants exit

**Quality Indicators**

Watch for signs of poor data quality:
- Unusually fast completion times
- Repetitive or nonsensical responses
- Extremely long response times (possible distraction)
- High skip rates on optional questions

### Managing Study Issues

**Common Issues and Solutions**

| Problem | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Low response rate | Few participants starting | Improve recruitment, check incentives |
| High drop-out rate | Many incomplete responses | Simplify questions, reduce study length |
| Poor response quality | Short, unhelpful answers | Add examples, improve question clarity |
| Technical issues | Error reports from participants | Test on multiple devices, check links |

## Data Analysis
