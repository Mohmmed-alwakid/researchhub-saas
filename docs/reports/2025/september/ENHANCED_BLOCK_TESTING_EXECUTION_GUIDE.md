**Description**: "Comprehensive test of all enhanced block types including rating scales, comparisons, navigation tasks, and feedback collection."

#### **Suggested Block Sequence:**
1. **Welcome Screen** 
   - Title: "Welcome to Our Enhanced Testing Study"
   - Description: "This study will test various interaction types to validate our enhanced block system."

2. **Task Instructions Block** ‚≠ê **ENHANCED**
   - Task: "Website Navigation Task"
   - Instructions: "Navigate to our homepage and find the pricing section"
   - Time Limit: 3 minutes
   - Success Criteria: "Successfully locate pricing information"

3. **Website Navigation Block** ‚≠ê **ENHANCED**
