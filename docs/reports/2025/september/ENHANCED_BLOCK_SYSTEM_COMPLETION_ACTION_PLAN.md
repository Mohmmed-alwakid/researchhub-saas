---

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Complete Study Publication** (Current Priority)
**Goal:** Create and publish a comprehensive Enhanced Block System validation study

**Action Items:**
1. **Log into production as researcher** (abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com)
2. **Complete study creation workflow:**
   - ‚úÖ Study Details: "Enhanced Block System Validation Study"
   - ‚úÖ Add all 6 enhanced blocks in logical sequence:
     - Welcome Screen
     - Task Instructions 
     - Website Navigation (with timing)
     - Rating Scale (SUS methodology)
     - A/B Comparison (design evaluation)
     - Feedback Collection
     - Thank You Screen
3. **Configure each block properly:**
   - Task Instructions: Clear participant guidance
   - Website Navigation: Target URL and success criteria  
   - Rating Scale: 1-10 scale with SUS questions
   - A/B Comparison: Two design options
   - Feedback: Open-ended experience questions
4. **Publish the study** for participant access
5. **Note the study URL/ID** for participant testing

### **Step 2: Execute Participant Testing** (Next Phase)
**Goal:** Complete participant experience validation

**Process:**
1. **Login as participant** (abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com)
2. **Discover and join** the published validation study
3. **Complete all enhanced blocks** systematically:
   - Navigate through welcome and instructions
   - Complete website navigation task with timing
   - Provide ratings using SUS methodology
   - Make A/B comparison selection
   - Submit detailed feedback
4. **Document experience** and any issues
5. **Mark participant testing as complete**

### **Step 3: Execute Researcher Analytics** (Final Phase)
**Goal:** Validate data collection and analysis capabilities

**Process:**
1. **Login as researcher** to review collected data
2. **Validate data collection:**
   - Navigation timing data captured
   - Rating scale responses recorded
   - A/B comparison selections stored
   - Feedback responses available
3. **Test analytics features:**
   - Individual response analysis
   - Aggregate data visualization
   - Export functionality (CSV, reports)
   - Insights generation
4. **Document research capabilities**
5. **Mark researcher testing as complete**
