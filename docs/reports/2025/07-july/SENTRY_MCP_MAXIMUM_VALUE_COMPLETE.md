## 📈 REAL-TIME MONITORING DATA

### Current Performance Metrics
```
📊 Active Monitoring: 10 traces tracked in last 24 hours
⚡ Page Load Performance:
  - Login page: 3.72s (needs optimization)
  - Study Editor: 2.51s (acceptable)
  - Average: 2.5s across all pages

🎯 Error Status: 0 unresolved issues (excellent!)
📱 User Impact: No users currently affected by errors
```

### Performance Insights Found
- **Slow login page (3.72s)**: CSS and component loading optimization needed
- **Resource loading delays**: Several components taking 1.8-1.9s to load
- **Optimization opportunities**: Bundle splitting and caching improvements identified
