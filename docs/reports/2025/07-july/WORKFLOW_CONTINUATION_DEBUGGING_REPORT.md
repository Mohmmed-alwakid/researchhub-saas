# Workflow Continuation - Debugging Report
**Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Status**: Debugging Login Issues & Continuing E2E Test

## üîç Current Status

### Completed So Far
‚úÖ **User Story 1**: Researcher creates study - COMPLETED (E-commerce study exists)  
‚úÖ **User Story 2**: Participant discovers and applies - COMPLETED (partially - reached application page)  
üîÑ **User Story 3**: Researcher reviews/accepts application - IN PROGRESS  
‚è≥ **User Story 4**: Participant completes study - PENDING  

### Issues Encountered

#### 1. Login Form Stability Issues
- **Problem**: Login button becomes disabled/unstable during form filling
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Button state changes rapidly between enabled/disabled
  - Form elements not found during JavaScript evaluation
  - Token refresh errors in console logs
- **Console Errors**:
  ```
  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
  Token refresh failed: AxiosError
  ```

#### 2. Frontend Loading Issues
- **Problem**: Page elements not loading properly for form interaction
- **Evidence**: JavaScript evaluation shows 0 inputs and 0 buttons found
- **Likely Cause**: Client-side routing or authentication state management issues

### üîß Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. **Server Restart**: Killed all node processes and restarted `npm run dev:fullstack`
2. **Browser Connection Reset**: Ended Playwright session and prepared for fresh start
3. **Console Log Analysis**: Identified token refresh and authentication errors
4. **Direct Navigation**: Attempted direct navigation to `/login` route

### üìù Next Steps to Complete Testing

#### Option 1: Manual Testing Approach
1. **Manual Browser Testing**: Use regular browser to complete remaining workflows
2. **API Direct Testing**: Test API endpoints directly using HTTP requests
3. **Database Verification**: Check database state for applications and study completion

#### Option 2: Playwright Testing with Fixes
1. **Wait Strategies**: Implement proper wait conditions for dynamic elements
2. **Authentication Handling**: Add token management to Playwright tests
3. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for unstable form interactions

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. **Complete critical workflow manually** to verify end-to-end functionality
2. **Generate comprehensive test report** based on manual testing
3. **Create stable Playwright tests** for future regression testing

## üéØ Critical Workflow Steps Remaining

### User Story 3: Researcher Reviews Application
**Goal**: Researcher logs in, sees pending applications, accepts participant application

**Steps**:
1. Login as researcher (`abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com`)
2. Navigate to "My Studies" or "Applications" section
3. Find pending application for "E-commerce Checkout Flow Testing" study
4. Review participant profile and application details
5. Accept the application
6. Verify participant receives acceptance notification

### User Story 4: Participant Completes Study
**Goal**: Accepted participant completes the actual study session

**Steps**:
1. Login as participant (`abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com`)
2. Navigate to "My Studies" or "Active Studies"
3. Find accepted study "E-commerce Checkout Flow Testing"
4. Start the study session
5. Complete all study blocks:
   - Welcome Screen
   - Prototype Test (5-Second Test)
   - Open Question (feedback)
   - Thank You Screen
6. Verify study completion is recorded
7. Check researcher can see completed session data

## üîß Technical Debugging Notes

### Authentication Token Management
The application seems to have issues with token refresh during page transitions. This might be causing the form instability.

**Potential Solutions**:
- Implement proper token validation before form submission
- Add loading states during authentication processes
- Improve error handling for expired tokens

### Form Validation Logic
The login form appears to have complex validation that may be causing the button to become disabled unexpectedly.

**Investigation Needed**:
- Check if email/password validation is working correctly
- Verify form submission prerequisites
- Review client-side validation logic

### Page Loading and Routing
React Router or component mounting issues may be causing elements to not render properly.

**Areas to Investigate**:
- Component lifecycle and mounting
- Route protection and authentication guards
- State management during navigation

## üìä Current Database State

Based on previous testing, we should have:
- ‚úÖ Active study: "E-commerce Checkout Flow Testing"
- ‚úÖ Researcher account: `abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com`
- ‚úÖ Participant account: `abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com`
- ‚ùì Pending application: Need to verify if application was submitted successfully

## üéØ Immediate Action Plan

1. **Verify Database State**: Check if application was actually submitted in previous test
2. **Manual Workflow Completion**: Complete remaining user stories manually
3. **Document Results**: Create comprehensive test results documentation
4. **Identify Automation Blockers**: Document specific issues preventing full automation
5. **Recommend Fixes**: Provide specific technical recommendations for developers

**Next Update**: After completing manual testing of remaining workflow steps
