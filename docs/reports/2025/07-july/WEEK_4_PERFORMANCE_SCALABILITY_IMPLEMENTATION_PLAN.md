## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Optimization Strategy

#### Critical Indexes to Implement
```sql
-- Organization performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_organization_members_user_lookup 
ON organization_members(user_id, organization_id, role);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_study_collaborators_performance 
ON study_collaborators(study_id, user_id, role) 
INCLUDE (permissions, added_at);

-- Activity logging indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_collaboration_activity_timeline 
ON collaboration_activity(study_id, created_at DESC, activity_type);

-- Studies performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_studies_organization_lookup 
ON studies(organization_id, status, created_at DESC);
```

#### Query Optimization Targets
1. **Organization Member Lookups**: Optimize role-based access queries
2. **Study Collaboration Queries**: Improve collaborator permission checks
3. **Activity Feed Queries**: Optimize timeline and filtering queries
4. **Analytics Aggregations**: Efficient team metrics calculations

### Redis Caching Strategy

#### Cache Keys Structure
```typescript
// Cache key patterns
const CACHE_KEYS = {
  USER_ORGANIZATIONS: (userId: string) => `user:${userId}:organizations`,
  ORGANIZATION_MEMBERS: (orgId: string) => `org:${orgId}:members`,
  STUDY_COLLABORATORS: (studyId: string) => `study:${studyId}:collaborators`,
  TEAM_ANALYTICS: (teamId: string) => `team:${teamId}:analytics`,
  USER_PERMISSIONS: (userId: string, studyId: string) => `permissions:${userId}:${studyId}`
};

// Cache TTL (Time To Live) settings
const CACHE_TTL = {
  ORGANIZATIONS: 3600, // 1 hour
  COLLABORATORS: 1800, // 30 minutes
  PERMISSIONS: 900,    // 15 minutes
  ANALYTICS: 300       // 5 minutes
};
```

#### Cache Implementation Pattern
```typescript
// Generic cache wrapper
export const withCache = async <T>(
  key: string,
  fetchFn: () => Promise<T>,
  ttl: number = 3600
): Promise<T> => {
  const cached = await redis.get(key);
  
  if (cached) {
    return JSON.parse(cached);
  }
  
  const data = await fetchFn();
  await redis.setex(key, ttl, JSON.stringify(data));
  return data;
};
```

### Rate Limiting Configuration

#### Rate Limit Tiers
```typescript
const RATE_LIMITS = {
  // Per-user limits (requests per minute)
  AUTHENTICATED_USER: 100,
  ORGANIZATION_ADMIN: 200,
  API_ENDPOINTS: {
    '/api/organizations': 20,
    '/api/collaboration/*': 50,
    '/api/analytics/*': 30
  },
  
  // Burst limits (requests per second)
  BURST_LIMIT: 10,
  
  // Enterprise tier adjustments
  ENTERPRISE_MULTIPLIER: 3
};
```
