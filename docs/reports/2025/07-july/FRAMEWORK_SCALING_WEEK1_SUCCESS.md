### ✅ Team Commands Available

```bash
# Core Framework Commands
npm run start-improvement     # Initialize new improvement with framework
npm run team-dashboard       # View team-wide progress and metrics
npm run validate-framework   # Run all quality gates and validators
npm run track-progress      # Show completion dashboard
npm run update-progress     # Update improvement completion percentage

# Quality Assurance
npm run quality-gates       # Run all validators + progress check
npm run pre-deploy         # Pre-deployment validation
