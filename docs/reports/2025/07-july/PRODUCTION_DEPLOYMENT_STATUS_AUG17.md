# Production Deployment Status - August 17, 2025

## JWT Token Parsing Fix Status
- ‚úÖ **Local Environment**: JWT parsing implemented and working
- üîÑ **Production Environment**: Deployment in progress
- ‚è∞ **Expected Resolution**: 2-3 minutes for Vercel auto-deployment

## Issue Summary
User reported that studies created on production (https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app) are not visible in the studies list, even though study creation appears to work.

## Root Cause
The JWT token parsing implementation was applied locally but needs to be deployed to production via Vercel's auto-deployment system.

## Current Action
Triggering production deployment to ensure JWT parsing fix is live on production environment.

## Timeline
- **11:XX AM**: JWT fix implemented locally
- **11:XX AM**: Navigation spacing fixes applied
- **11:XX AM**: Changes committed to main branch
- **11:XX AM**: Production deployment triggered (this file)
- **Expected**: Studies should be visible within 5 minutes

## Verification Steps
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment
2. Login to production: `abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com / Testtest123`
3. Create a new study via Study Builder
4. Navigate to Studies page
5. ‚úÖ Study should now appear in the list

## Technical Details
The fix ensures JWT tokens are properly parsed to identify user roles, allowing researchers to see their created studies instead of being filtered out as "participants".
