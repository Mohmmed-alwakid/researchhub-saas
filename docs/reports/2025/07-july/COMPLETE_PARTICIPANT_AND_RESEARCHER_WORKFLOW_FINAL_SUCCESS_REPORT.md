## 🔧 Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. **"undefined study ID" Bug - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Study cards showing `/studies/undefined` navigation links
- **Root Cause**: Backend API was returning `_id` instead of `id` field
- **Solution**: Updated backend to always return both `_id` and `id` fields
- **Result**: ✅ All study links now work correctly

### 2. **"Invalid API Key" Error - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Participant applications not loading due to Supabase API key typo
- **Root Cause**: `"rose"` instead of `"role"` in JWT payload
- **Solution**: Fixed typo in `api/applications.js` line 930
- **Result**: ✅ Participant applications now display correctly

### 3. **Missing Backend Endpoints - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Applications API**: Complete CRUD operations for participant and researcher applications
- **Study Applications**: Endpoint for researchers to view study-specific applications
- **Application Review**: Backend support for accepting/rejecting applications
- **Result**: ✅ Full API coverage for application management

### 4. **Authentication & Authorization - WORKING**
- **User-Specific Clients**: Fixed RLS policy compliance with participant JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper separation between participant and researcher endpoints
- **Token Validation**: Comprehensive auth validation across all API endpoints
- **Result**: ✅ Secure, role-based application workflow
