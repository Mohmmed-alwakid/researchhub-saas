### State Management
```typescript
const [state, setState] = useState<InterviewState>('pre-interview');
const [zoomClient, setZoomClient] = useState<unknown>(null);
const [meetingConnected, setMeetingConnected] = useState(false);
const [audioEnabled, setAudioEnabled] = useState(true);
const [videoEnabled, setVideoEnabled] = useState(true);
const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState('');
const [interviewMetadata, setInterviewMetadata] = useState<InterviewMetadata>({...});
```

## 🧪 TESTING STATUS

### ✅ Ready for Testing
1. **Component Rendering** - All interview states render correctly
2. **Zoom SDK Initialization** - SDK setup logic in place
3. **Event Handling** - Connection and recording event listeners

case 'interview':
  return <InterviewTask task={task} study={study} session={session} onComplete={onComplete} isRecording={isRecording} />;
```

### Study Builder Integration
Ready for study configuration with:
```typescript
interface InterviewTaskConfiguration {
  platform: 'zoom' | 'google-meet' | 'teams';
  duration: number;
  recordingEnabled: boolean;
  transcriptionEnabled: boolean;
  interviewerInfo: { name: string; email: string; role: string };
  questions: string[];
  instructions: string;
  zoomConfig: ZoomMeetingConfig;
}
```
