  - **Moderated Interviews**: Live video interviews, scheduling, transcription
  - Intuitive icons and visual hierarchy
  - Proper routing to appropriate builders

### 2. ✅ Updated Dashboard Integration
- **File**: `src/client/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced old `MazeInspiredStudyCreationModal` with `SimplifiedStudyCreationModal`
  - Updated routing logic for both study types
  - Clean modal state management

### 3. ✅ Updated Studies Page Integration  
- **File**: `src/client/pages/studies/StudiesPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced old modal with new simplified version
  - Consistent routing across both pages
  - Maintained existing functionality

### 4. ✅ Interview Builder Page Created
- **File**: `src/client/pages/studies/InterviewBuilderPage.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Complete interview setup form

  - Research Objectives: Dynamic add/remove
  - Interview Settings: Duration, participants, timezone, compensation
  - Recording & Transcription: Audio/video options
  - Interview Guide: Instructions and question management
  - Full backend integration with proper study creation

### 5. ✅ Routing Configuration Updated
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `InterviewBuilderPage`
  - Added route: `/app/studies/create-interview`
  - Proper role-based protection for researchers/admins

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Manual Testing Completed
- **Login Flow**: ✅ Researcher account authentication works

**Test Study Created**: "User Onboarding Interview Study"
- ✅ Appears in studies list with interview icon (🎤)
- ✅ Correct type and status (Interview, Draft)
- ✅ Proper description and metadata
- ✅ Backend database integration working

### ✅ Technical Validation
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ 0 errors
- **Frontend Server**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:5175
- **Backend API**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:3003
- **Database Integration**: ✅ Supabase connection working
- **Authentication**: ✅ Role-based access control working

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### Before (Complex Multi-Step Flow)
1. Click "Create Study"
2. Select research intent/goal
3. Choose from multiple templates
4. Navigate through template preview
5. Finally reach Study Builder

### After (Simplified Flow)
1. Click "Create Study" 
2. Choose **one of two clear options**:
   - **Unmoderated Study** → Study Builder (blocks system)
   - **Moderated Interviews** → Interview Builder (scheduling/settings)

**Result**: Reduced complexity from 5 steps to 2 steps with clearer decision points.

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Study Creation Flow
```
Dashboard/Studies Page
        ↓
SimplifiedStudyCreationModal
        ↓
   [User Choice]
        ↓
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Unmoderated     │ Moderated       │
│ Study           │ Interviews      │
│        ↓        │        ↓        │
│ StudyBuilder    │ InterviewBuilder│
│ (blocks system) │ (settings form) │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Backend Integration
- **Unmoderated Studies**: Use existing study blocks system
- **Moderated Interviews**: Use interview-specific settings schema
- **Both**: Integrate with same studies API with different `type` field

## 🔧 Development Environment

**Local Development Running**:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5175
- Backend: http://localhost:3003  
- Database: Supabase production connection
- Hot reload: Enabled for both frontend and backend

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **Template Integration**: Add template selection within each flow
2. **Advanced Interview Features**: Calendar integration, automated reminders
3. **Block Library Enhancement**: New block types for unmoderated studies
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track usage of each study type
5. **User Onboarding**: Guided tours for new researchers
