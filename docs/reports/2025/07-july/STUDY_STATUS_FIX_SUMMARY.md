# Study Status Fix - Quick Reference

**Date**: June 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Issue**: Studies showing "draft" after launching with "active" status  

## 🔍 Root Cause
Frontend caching issue - StudiesPage wasn't refreshing data when returning from Study Builder.

## 🛠️ Solution
Enhanced StudiesPage with 3 refresh mechanisms:
1. **Automatic**: Detects return from Study Builder
2. **Focus-based**: Refreshes when user returns to browser tab  
3. **Manual**: Added refresh button for user control

## 📋 Files Modified
- `src/client/pages/studies/StudiesPage.tsx` - Added refresh mechanisms
- `src/client/components/study-builder/steps/LaunchStep.tsx` - Updated navigation

## ✅ Verification
- ✅ API Test: Backend correctly handles status field
- ✅ UI Test: Studies page shows correct status after launch
- ✅ Build Test: No TypeScript errors
- ✅ E2E Test: Complete workflow verified with Playwright
