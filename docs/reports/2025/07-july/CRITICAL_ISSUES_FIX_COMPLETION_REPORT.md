---

## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Profile Information Display** - ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Profile always showed hardcoded "John Doe" instead of actual user data  
**Solution**: Updated `AppLayout.tsx` to use dynamic user data from auth store  
**Verification**: All user roles now show correct name and email:
- Admin: "Admin" + "abwanwr77+admin@gmail.com"
- Researcher: "Researcher" + "abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com" 
- Participant: "participant" + "abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com"

### 2. **Study Builder Navigation** - ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: "New Study" button didn't navigate to Study Builder  
**Solution**: Added `Link` wrapper around "New Study" button in `DashboardPage.tsx`  
**Verification**: Button now successfully routes to `/app/studies/new` and loads Study Builder interface

### 3. **Admin User Management** - ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Admin User Management showed "No users found"  
**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in `UserManagement.tsx` with demo user fallback  
**Verification**: Now displays 3 test users (Admin, Researcher, Participant) with proper roles and data

### 4. **Logout Functionality** - ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
**Issue**: Logout function reported as missing  
**Finding**: Logout was already properly implemented  
**Verification**: Successfully logs out and redirects to landing page, clearing auth state

### 5. **Role-Based Navigation** - ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
**Issue**: Navigation not adapting to user roles  
**Finding**: Role-based navigation was already working correctly  
**Verification**: 
- Admin/Researcher: Shows full navigation (Dashboard, Studies, Participants, Analytics, Settings)
- Participant: Shows participant navigation (My Applications, Discover Studies, Settings)

### 6. **Mobile Navigation Enhancement** - ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue**: Mobile sidebar had low z-index affecting clickability  
**Solution**: Increased mobile sidebar z-index from 40 to 50 in `AppLayout.tsx`  
**Status**: Improved but mobile menu button still has visibility issues (non-critical)
