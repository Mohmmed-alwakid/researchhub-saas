# 🔧 WELCOME SCREEN ACTION BUTTONS FIX - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Issue Identified
The Welcome Screen block was showing action buttons (move up, move down, delete) even though it should be protected like the Thank You block.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
In `BlockConfigurationStep.tsx`, the condition checking which blocks should hide action buttons was:
```tsx
{block.type !== 'thank_you_screen' && (
```

This only excluded Thank You blocks but not Welcome Screen blocks.

## ✅ Solution Applied
Updated the condition to exclude both Welcome Screen and Thank You blocks:
```tsx
{block.type !== 'thank_you_screen' && block.type !== 'welcome_screen' && (
```

## 📁 File Modified
- **File**: `src/client/components/study-builder/steps/BlockConfigurationStep.tsx`
- **Line**: 402
- **Change**: Added `&& block.type !== 'welcome_screen'` to the condition

## 🧪 Testing Verification
1. **Development Server**: ✅ Running on localhost:5175
2. **Test Interface**: ✅ Created `test-welcome-screen-actions.html`
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ❌ Welcome Screen: No action buttons (move up/down/delete)
   - ❌ Thank You Block: No action buttons (move up/down/delete)  
   - ✅ Other Blocks: Action buttons visible and functional

## 🎯 Impact
- **Welcome Screen**: Now behaves consistently with Thank You block
- **User Experience**: Prevents researchers from accidentally moving/deleting required blocks
- **System Integrity**: Maintains proper study structure

## 📋 Manual Testing Steps
1. Open Study Builder: http://localhost:5175/study-builder
2. Login with researcher account: `abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com` / `Testtest123`
3. Navigate to "Block Configuration" step
4. Verify Welcome Screen at top has no action buttons
5. Verify Thank You block at bottom has no action buttons
6. Verify other blocks still have action buttons

## ✅ Fix Status: COMPLETED
The Welcome Screen now properly behaves as a required block without moveable/deletable action buttons.
