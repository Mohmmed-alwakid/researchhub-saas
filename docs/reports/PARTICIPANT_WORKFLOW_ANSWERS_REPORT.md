# Participant Workflow Answers Report

## Executive Summary
Testing the complete participant workflow to answer the user's 4 specific questions about participant experience functionality.

## Questions & Answers

### 1. Does participant answer screening questions? ‚úÖ YES
**Status: CONFIRMED**

**Evidence:**
- Screening questions are implemented in the study application modal
- Questions include:
  - Eligibility confirmation checkbox (required)
  - "Why are you interested in this study?" (required textarea)
  - "Relevant experience or background" (required textarea)  
  - Age range dropdown (required)
  - Technology usage frequency dropdown (required)

**Test Results:**
- Application modal opens successfully when clicking "Apply Now"
- All screening questions are present and functional
- Form validation works (required fields marked with *)
- Responses are collected in state for submission

### 2. Participant shouldn't see the draft study ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS
**Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Current Issue:**
- Backend filtering implemented to only show 'active' and 'recruiting' studies for participants
- Frontend has additional filtering logic as backup
- However, runtime errors are preventing proper testing

**Backend Changes Made:**
```javascript
// Added role-based filtering in research-consolidated.js
const userRole = auth.user.user_metadata?.role || 'participant';
const isParticipant = userRole === 'participant';

if (isParticipant) {
  query = query.in('status', ['active', 'recruiting']);
}
```

**Current Status:**
- Filter logic is correct and in place
- Need to resolve runtime errors to test effectiveness
- Expected behavior: Participants should only see studies with status 'active' or 'recruiting'

### 3. Can participant do the study? ‚è≥ PENDING
**Status: NOT YET TESTED**

**Requirements for Testing:**
- Need functioning study discovery page (currently has runtime errors)
- Need to test study execution workflow
- Verify participants can access and complete study tasks
- Check if study interfaces are accessible to participants

**Next Steps:**
- Fix current runtime errors
- Navigate to an active study
- Test study execution flow
- Verify completion and submission process

### 4. Can researcher view their answer? ‚è≥ PENDING  
**Status: NOT YET TESTED**

**Requirements for Testing:**
- Need researcher account access
- Need submitted participant responses
- Test researcher dashboard functionality
- Verify response viewing capabilities

**Next Steps:**
- Complete participant application submission
- Switch to researcher account
- Test researcher dashboard for viewing responses
- Verify data display and export capabilities

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Runtime Error
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
at StudyDiscovery (http://localhost:5175/src/client/components/participant/StudyDiscovery.tsx:920:19)
```

**Analysis:**
- Studies array is undefined, causing map() to fail
- API call may be failing or returning unexpected data
- Backend server restart may be needed for filtering changes

### Backend Configuration
- Fullstack development server running on localhost:3003
- Frontend running on localhost:5175
- Supabase integration active with proper authentication
- Role-based filtering implemented

## Achievements ‚úÖ

1. **Screening Questions Implementation:** Complete with comprehensive form validation
2. **Backend Filtering Logic:** Implemented role-based study visibility
3. **Authentication System:** Fully functional with participant role detection
4. **Application Modal:** Working form with proper data collection

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix Runtime Errors:** Resolve undefined studies array issue
2. **Test Draft Filtering:** Verify participants can't see draft studies
3. **Study Execution Testing:** Navigate through complete study workflow
4. **Researcher Dashboard:** Test response viewing capabilities

## Test Environment Status

- **Frontend:** ‚úÖ Running (localhost:5175)
- **Backend:** ‚úÖ Running (localhost:3003) 
- **Authentication:** ‚úÖ Working (participant role confirmed)
- **Database:** ‚úÖ Connected (17 studies available)
- **MCP Playwright:** ‚úÖ Functional

## User Role Confirmation

```
üîç AppLayout - Enhanced User Role Debug: {
  user: Object, 
  userRole: participant, 
  userRoleType: string, 
  userEmail: abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com, 
  userFirstName: participant
}
```

Participant role is correctly identified and passed to backend for filtering.
