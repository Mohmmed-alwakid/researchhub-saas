## 🎯 Available Commands

Your adaptive testing system is now ready with these npm commands:

```bash
# Adaptive Testing Commands
npm run test:adaptive         # Run full adaptive testing suite
npm run test:generate         # Generate tests for current changes
npm run test:coverage         # Analyze test coverage and gaps
npm run test:watch           # Start continuous change monitoring
npm run test:optimize        # Optimize existing test suite
npm run test:analyze         # Analyze current codebase changes
npm run test:validate-system # Validate adaptive system health

# Traditional Testing Commands (Enhanced)
npm run test:daily           # Enhanced daily tests with adaptive features
npm run test:weekly          # Comprehensive weekly testing
npm run test:deployment      # Pre-deployment validation
npm run test:smoke           # Quick smoke tests
npm run test:performance     # Performance testing
npm run test:security        # Security validation
npm run test:accessibility   # Accessibility compliance
```

## 🔄 How the Adaptive System Works

### 1. **Continuous Change Detection**
```bash
npm run test:watch
```
- Monitors your codebase in real-time
- Detects file changes (add, modify, delete)
- Categorizes changes by type and impact
- Triggers appropriate test generation

### 2. **Automatic Test Generation**
```bash
npm run test:generate
```
- Analyzes detected changes
- Generates appropriate test types:
  - API changes → API, integration, security tests
  - Component changes → Unit, integration, accessibility tests
  - Requirements changes → E2E, integration, regression tests
  - Config changes → Integration, deployment tests

### 3. **Intelligent Coverage Analysis**
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
- Tracks coverage across multiple dimensions
- Identifies testing gaps with priority scoring
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Generates comprehensive reports

### 4. **Continuous Optimization**
```bash
npm run test:optimize
```
- Identifies slow and redundant tests
- Suggests performance improvements
- Optimizes test execution order
- Reduces overall testing time
