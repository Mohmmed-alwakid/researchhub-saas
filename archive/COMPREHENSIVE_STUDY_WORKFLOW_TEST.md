## üêõ Issue Tracking

### Issues Found
| Issue | Description | Severity | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Session Timeout | User logged out during task configuration save in study creation workflow | Critical | Open |
| Studies Page Empty | /app/studies endpoint returns empty content, preventing study management | Critical | Open |
| Study Discovery Failure | /app/study-discovery and /app/discover return empty content | Critical | Open |
| Participant Session Timeout | Automatic logout when navigating participant dashboard | Critical | Open |
| Authentication State | Session management appears unstable during multi-step processes | High | Open |

### Notes
- Session timeout occurs specifically when saving task configuration during study creation
- Multiple login attempts required due to unexpected logouts
- Study creation workflow is interrupted, preventing end-to-end testing
- Studies management page inaccessible due to loading issues
- Authentication appears to work for initial login but fails during extended workflows

## üèÅ Test Conclusion

**Status**: **WORKFLOW CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

While ResearchHub demonstrates strong authentication capabilities and role-based access control, the current session management and page routing issues prevent successful completion of the core study workflow. These critical issues must be resolved before the platform can support end-to-end study creation and participation processes.

**Positive Findings:**
- Authentication system works for initial login
- Role-based dashboards load correctly
- Basic navigation and UI components function well
- Study creation form accepts and validates input properly
- Participant dashboard displays correctly with appropriate features

**Critical Blockers:**
- Session timeouts interrupt multi-step workflows
- Key pages (studies, study discovery) fail to load
- Cannot complete core business processes

**Recommendation**: Address session management and page loading issues before proceeding with production deployment.
