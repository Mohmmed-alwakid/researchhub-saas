# MCP Playwright Automation - Post-Approval Study Execution Test Results

## 🎯 Test Objective
Verify that the MCP Playwright automation can successfully test the post-approval study execution workflow in the ResearchHub platform.

## ✅ Test Results Summary

### 🔧 **MCP Playwright Automation Fix - SUCCESSFUL**
- **Issue**: MCP Playwright expected chromium-1179 but local installation had chromium-1178
- **Solution**: Used MCP Desktop Commander to copy chromium-1178 to chromium-1179 directory
- **Command Used**: `xcopy "chromium-1178" "chromium-1179" /E /I /H /Y`
- **Result**: ✅ MCP Playwright automation now working correctly

### 🚀 **Local Development Environment - OPERATIONAL**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5175 - ✅ Running
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3003 - ✅ Running  
- **Database**: Supabase connection - ✅ Connected
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3003/api/health - ✅ Operational

### 🔐 **Authentication Testing - SUCCESSFUL**
- **Test Account**: abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com / Testtest123
- **Login Process**: ✅ Successful login via MCP Playwright
- **Role Verification**: ✅ Correctly identified as participant (John Doe)
- **Dashboard Access**: ✅ Accessed participant dashboard at /app/participant-dashboard

### 📋 **Study Discovery - PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL**
- **Navigation**: ✅ Successfully navigated to /app/discover
- **Study Visibility**: ✅ Found 1 available study
- **Study Details Verified**:
  - **Title**: E-commerce Checkout Flow Testing
  - **Type**: Usability Test  
  - **Duration**: 30 minutes
  - **Compensation**: $25
  - **Participants**: 0/10 (0% filled)
  - **Date**: 6/21/2025
  - **Researcher**: Research Team

### ⚠️ **Study Application Process - ROUTING ISSUE IDENTIFIED**
- **Issue**: Clicking "Apply to Study" attempts to navigate to "/app/study-discovery" 
- **Problem**: Route "/app/study-discovery" doesn't exist in routing configuration
- **Expected Route**: "/app/studies/:id/apply" (based on App.tsx routing)
- **Impact**: Cannot complete study application via UI

## 🔍 **Technical Analysis**

### **Routing Configuration (from App.tsx)**
```typescript
// Correct participant routes:
<Route path="participant-dashboard" element={<ParticipantDashboardPage />} />
<Route path="discover" element={<StudyDiscoveryPage />} />
<Route path="studies/:id/apply" element={<StudyApplicationPage />} />
```

### **Identified Issue**
The StudyDiscoveryPage component appears to have incorrect navigation logic that tries to go to "/app/study-discovery" instead of "/app/studies/:id/apply".

## 🧪 **MCP Playwright Automation Capabilities Verified**

### ✅ **Successfully Tested**
1. **Browser Launch**: Chromium browser launching correctly
2. **Navigation**: Multiple URL navigation commands
3. **Element Interaction**: Clicking buttons, filling forms
4. **Content Verification**: Reading visible text and HTML
5. **API Testing**: GET requests to local API endpoints
6. **Console Log Monitoring**: Capturing and analyzing browser console logs
7. **Authentication Flow**: Complete login process automation

### 🔧 **MCP Desktop Commander Integration**
- **File System Operations**: Directory listing, file copying
- **Process Management**: Killing processes, checking running services
- **Command Execution**: PowerShell commands, npm scripts
- **Browser Management**: Playwright browser installation and configuration

## 📊 **Test Coverage Status**

| Workflow Step | Status | Notes |
