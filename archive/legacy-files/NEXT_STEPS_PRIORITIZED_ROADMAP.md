## üí° **TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Development Approach:**
1. **Iterative Implementation** - Build one block type at a time
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Use Playwright for automated validation
3. **API-First Design** - Build endpoints before UI components
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Track metrics during development

### **Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Keep Current Stack** - React + TypeScript + Supabase is working well
2. **Modular Block System** - Maintain current block architecture
3. **Real-time Features** - Use Supabase real-time for notifications
4. **Session Management** - Store in database with proper indexing

### **Quality Assurance:**
1. **Automated Testing** - Expand Playwright test coverage
2. **Performance Testing** - Load test with simulated users
3. **Security Auditing** - Regular RLS policy validation
4. **User Experience Testing** - Test with real researchers and participants
