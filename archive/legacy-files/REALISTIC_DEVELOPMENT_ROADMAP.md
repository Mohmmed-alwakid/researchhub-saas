## ðŸš§ CURRENT DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Update all documentation** to reflect actual status
2. **Add "Coming Soon" labels** to incomplete features
3. **Create feature flags** to hide non-functional components
4. **Start WebRTC implementation** for screen recording

### Development Priorities
1. **Core functionality first**: Recording and analytics
2. **User experience focus**: Make working features excellent
3. **Incremental delivery**: Deploy working features as completed
4. **Quality over speed**: Build it right the first time

## ðŸ“ˆ SUCCESS METRICS

### Phase 1 Success (Month 3)
- Screen recording fully functional
- Real user interaction data collected
- Analytics show actual usage data

### Phase 2 Success (Month 6)  
- Real-time features working
- Advanced analytics implemented
- Payment system fully automated

### Phase 3 Success (Month 9)
- Performance targets met

## ðŸŽ¯ CONCLUSION

This roadmap provides a realistic path to building ResearchHub into a true user research platform. The current foundation is solid, but the core research features need to be built from the ground up.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Focus on core functionality first
- Build real features, not mockups
- Incremental delivery and testing
- Quality implementation over speed

**Estimated Total Development Time**: 9 months with focused team
**Estimated Cost**: $200k-$400k depending on team composition
**Risk Factors**: WebRTC complexity, real-time infrastructure, analytics pipeline
