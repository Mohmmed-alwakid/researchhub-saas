**Date**: June 3, 2025

---

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### ✅ Pre-Deployment Complete
- [x] **Vercel Frontend**: Deployed to https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app
- [x] **Server Build**: Verified working with `npm run build:server`
- [x] **Railway Config**: `railway.toml` ready with proper build commands
- [x] **Environment Variables**: All production variables prepared
- [x] **CORS Setup**: Frontend and backend origins configured
- [x] **MongoDB**: Atlas database connected and tested
- [x] **Vite Config**: Updated to handle `VITE_` environment variables

### 🔄 Current Task: Railway Backend Deployment

**📖 Follow**: `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` for step-by-step instructions

**Quick Steps**:
1. **Deploy Backend**: https://railway.app/new → Deploy from GitHub
2. **Add Environment Variables**: Copy from `RAILWAY_ENV_VARS.txt`
3. **Get Railway URL**: Copy generated URL after deployment
4. **Update Frontend**: Set `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel environment
5. **Test Full Stack**: Verify end-to-end functionality

---

## 🎯 POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### Backend Verification
```bash
# Replace YOUR-RAILWAY-URL with actual URL
curl https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/api/health
# Expected: {"success": true, "message": "ResearchHub API is running"}
```

### Frontend Verification
```bash
curl https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app
# Expected: HTML response with React app
```

### End-to-End Testing
1. **Visit**: https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app
2. **Register**: Create new account → should save to MongoDB
3. **Login**: Authentication → should return JWT tokens
4. **Create Study**: Study builder → should save to database
5. **Dashboard**: View studies → should load from backend API

- **Environment**: `VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.railway.app/api`

### Backend (Railway)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build:server` (from `railway.toml`)
- **Start Command**: `npm start`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Port**: 5000

### Database (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Connection**: Ready and tested
- **URI**: Configured in Railway environment variables
- **Collections**: Users, Studies, Sessions, etc.

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Railway Deployment Fails:
1. Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify `package.json` has `start` script
3. Ensure all environment variables are set

### If Frontend Can't Connect:
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is correctly set in Vercel
2. Check Railway URL is accessible
3. Verify CORS includes Vercel domain

### If Authentication Fails:
1. Check JWT secrets in Railway environment
2. Verify MongoDB connection in Railway logs
3. Test backend health endpoint
