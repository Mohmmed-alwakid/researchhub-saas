🔸 Session Details ✅ SUCCESS (study context retrieved)
🔸 Progress Updates ✅ SUCCESS (session tracking working)
🔸 Session Completion ✅ SUCCESS (full lifecycle completed)
```

## 🛠️ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

### 🔧 **Authentication Token Format**
- **Problem**: API calls failing with 401 errors due to `accessToken` vs `access_token` mismatch
- **Solution**: Updated all workflow scripts to use correct Supabase auth response format
- **Impact**: Resolved authentication failures across all API endpoints

### 🔧 **Missing API Function**
- **Problem**: `reviewStudyApplication` function called but not implemented
- **Solution**: Implemented complete function with authentication, authorization, and database updates
- **Impact**: Enabled researcher approval workflow to function properly

### 🔧 **Database Schema Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Code using non-existent `reviewer_feedback` column
- **Solution**: Updated to use correct table schema (`notes`, `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`)
- **Impact**: Application approval updates now save correctly

### 🔧 **Researcher Endpoint Optimization**
- **Problem**: Researchers getting 0 applications with generic endpoint
- **Solution**: Implemented study-specific endpoint for targeted application retrieval
- **Impact**: Researchers now see applications specific to their studies

## 📊 TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

### API ENDPOINTS TESTED & WORKING
```
✅ Authentication Endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth?action=login (Participant & Researcher)
   - GET /api/auth?action=status (Token validation)

✅ Application Endpoints:
   - GET /api/applications?endpoint=studies/public (Study discovery)
   - POST /api/applications?type=participant (Application submission)
   - GET /api/applications?endpoint=study/{id}/applications (Review)
   - PATCH /api/applications?endpoint=applications/{id}/review (Approval)

✅ Session Management Endpoints:
   - POST /api/study-sessions (Session creation)
   - GET /api/study-sessions/{id} (Session details)
   - PATCH /api/study-sessions/{id} (Progress updates)
   - POST /api/study-sessions/{id}?action=complete (Completion)
```

### DATABASE INTEGRATION VERIFIED
```
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Working
✅ Data Persistence Across All Tables
✅ User Role Enforcement
✅ Application Status Workflow
✅ Session Lifecycle Management
```
