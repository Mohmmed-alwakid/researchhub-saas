   - Enhanced JWT token handling and security measures

### ✅ Security Improvements
- **npm audit**: Reduced vulnerabilities from 16 to 13 (19% reduction)
- **Dependency Updates**: Applied security patches for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Security**: Eliminated potential security issues in TypeScript code

### ✅ Code Quality Enhancements
- **Unused Code Removal**: Eliminated unused imports, variables, and interfaces
- **Icon Standardization**: Fixed lucide-react import issues across all components
- **Interface Cleanup**: Streamlined component interfaces and prop definitions
- **Error Handling**: Improved error boundaries and validation throughout the app

## 🚧 In Progress - Current Focus Areas

### 1. UI/UX Component Consolidation
- **Status**: Script created and ready for execution
- **Goal**: Audit and consolidate design system components
- **Files**: `ui-improvement-script-fixed.js` created for automated analysis
- **Next Steps**: Complete script execution and implement recommendations

### 2. Security Hardening (13 remaining vulnerabilities)
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - `esbuild` vulnerabilities (moderate severity)
  - `path-to-regexp` backtracking issues (high severity)
  - `semver` regular expression DoS (high severity)
  - `undici` proxy authorization issues (moderate severity)
- **Approach**: Selective dependency updates and version pinning

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Large chunks identified in build output
- **Key Areas**: 
  - `index-DpcgXbWZ.js` (884.96 kB) - Main application bundle
  - `chunk-B8lVuIiC.js` (443.12 kB) - Component library chunk
- **Optimization Strategy**: Code splitting and lazy loading implementation
