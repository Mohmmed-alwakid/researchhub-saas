}
```

### ⚠️ IDENTIFIED BLOCKERS

#### 1. **Study-Database Synchronization Issue**
**Problem**: Studies shown in researcher UI don't all exist in database
- Studies visible in researcher dashboard are mostly demo/mock data
- Only "Test New Application Study" exists in actual database
- Newly created studies (like "Mobile App Navigation Study") don't persist to database

#### 2. **Application Submission Database Issue** 
**Problem**: Application submissions don't save to database
- Participant receives UI confirmation of application submission
- Database shows 0 applications in `study_applications` table
- Application API or RLS policies may be blocking inserts

#### 3. **Researcher Access Issue**
**Problem**: Test researcher account can't access real study
- Real study owned by different researcher (`9876c870-79e9-4106-99d6-9080049ec2aa`)
- Test researcher (`abwanwr77+researcher@gmail.com`) can't approve applications for studies they don't own
- Need access to the account that owns the real study

### 🛠️ TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

#### Database Structure
```sql
-- CONFIRMED: studies table exists with correct structure
-- Only 1 real study: "Test New Application Study" (ID: 2fd69681-3a09-49c5-b110-a06d8834aee8)

-- CONFIRMED: study_applications table exists but:
-- - Has Row Level Security (RLS) policies
-- - Preventing unauthorized inserts
-- - May have different column structure than expected
```

#### API Analysis
```javascript
// Public studies API working correctly (/api/applications?endpoint=studies/public)
// Filters by: status='active' AND is_public=true
// Returns properly formatted study data

// Applications API has RLS protection
// Requires proper authentication and authorization
```

#### Authentication Flow
```javascript
// All authentication working correctly:
// - Participant login: ✅ abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com
// - Researcher login: ✅ abwanwr77+researcher@gmail.com  
// - JWT tokens functioning
// - Role-based access control working
```

## 🔧 Required Actions to Complete Workflow

### Option 1: Fix Application Submission (Recommended)
1. **Debug application API** - Check why submissions aren't saving
2. **Verify RLS policies** - Ensure participants can create applications
3. **Test application creation** - Direct API testing

### Option 2: Use Service Role for Demo
1. **Create application manually** using service role key
2. **Bypass RLS** for demonstration purposes
3. **Continue with approval workflow**

### Option 3: Access Correct Researcher Account
1. **Identify the real researcher** who owns test study
2. **Use correct credentials** for study owner
3. **Approve applications** through proper account

## 📊 Current System Status

### ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS
- **Frontend UI**: Study builder, discovery page, application forms
- **Authentication**: Login/logout for all user types
- **Database**: Core tables exist with proper data
- **API Endpoints**: Basic functionality responding correctly
- **Study Builder**: Complete 6-step wizard functional
- **Template System**: Study templates working properly

### ⚠️ BLOCKED COMPONENTS
- **Application Submission**: UI works, database insert blocked
- **Study Persistence**: New studies don't save to database
- **Application Approval**: Can't access applications for real studies
- **Study Sessions**: Blocked until applications work

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Priority 1**: Debug and fix application submission API
2. **Priority 2**: Verify study creation database persistence
3. **Priority 3**: Complete application approval workflow
4. **Priority 4**: Test participant study session experience

## 🔍 Evidence Collected
- **Screenshots**: Study builder flow, discover page, application submission
- **Database queries**: Confirmed study and application table states
- **API responses**: Verified endpoint functionality
- **Console logs**: Detailed debugging information

## 💡 Key Learning
The ResearchHub platform has **solid infrastructure** with working UI components, authentication, and core database structure. The main blockers are **API-level issues** with data persistence, likely related to authentication, RLS policies, or API endpoint configuration. The frontend user experience is **production-ready** and all user flows are functional from a UI perspective.
