# 🚀 EXPRESS v4 FIX APPLIED - Railway Deployment Progress

## ✅ CRITICAL EXPRESS COMPATIBILITY FIX APPLIED

**Date**: June 4, 2025, 9:20 AM  
**Status**: 🟢 **EXPRESS v4 DOWNGRADE COMPLETED - DEPLOYMENT TRIGGERED**  
**Commit**: `366078c` - Express v4 downgrade & correct start path

---

## 🔧 ISSUES RESOLVED

### **Problem 1**: Express v5 Compatibility Issue
- ❌ **Error**: `Cannot find module 'path-to-regexp'` 
- ❌ **Cause**: Express v5.1.0 has breaking changes with path-to-regexp dependency
- ✅ **Solution**: Downgraded to Express v4.21.1 with proper TypeScript support

### **Problem 2**: Incorrect Start Command Path  
- ❌ **Error**: `Cannot find module '../../database/models/index.js'`
- ❌ **Cause**: Start command pointed to wrong path: `node dist/server/index.js`
- ✅ **Solution**: Fixed start command to: `node dist/server/server/index.js`

## 🔍 NEXT STEPS

### **1. Verify Railway Deployment**
- ✅ **Triggered**: GitHub push triggers new deployment
- 🔄 **Building**: Railway should be building with fixed code
- ⏳ **Expected**: Deployment should succeed with Express v4

### **2. Health Check Verification**
Once Railway deployment completes, test these endpoints:

# Replace [railway-domain] with actual domain
curl https://[railway-domain]/health
curl https://[railway-domain]/api/health
```

### **3. Update Vercel Frontend**
Update environment variables on Vercel:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://[railway-domain]
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://[railway-domain]/api
```

### **4. End-to-End Testing**
Test full-stack integration:
- User registration/login
- Study creation workflow
- Dashboard functionality
