## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (15 minutes)

### 1. Create Supabase Projects (5 minutes)
```
Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects
Create: researchhub-production, researchhub-staging, researchhub-development
Save: URLs and API keys for each project
```

### 2. Configure Vercel Environment Variables (5 minutes)  
```
Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
Configure: Production, Staging, Development environments
Use: Templates provided in .env.*.template files
```

### 3. Test New Workflow (5 minutes)
```powershell
# Test development environment
npm run dev:development

# Test staging deployment  
git checkout staging
git push origin staging

# Verify at staging URL
```

## 🔄 NEW DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### Daily Development:
```powershell
# No more local development!
npm run dev:development  # Cloud development environment

# Feature development
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
git push origin feature/your-feature  # Auto-creates preview URL
```

### Testing & Release:
```powershell
# Staging testing  
git checkout staging
git merge feature/your-feature
git push origin staging  # Auto-deploys to staging

# Production release
git checkout main  
git merge staging
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys to production
```
