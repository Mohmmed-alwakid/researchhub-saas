# Post-Approval Study Execution Test Report - Production Environment
**Test Date:** June 22, 2025  
**Environment:** Production (https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app/)  
**Test Objective:** Verify that approved participants can successfully do studies after approval

## üéØ Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL TESTS
1. **Landing Page Access** - ‚úÖ PASS
   - Production site loaded successfully
   - All marketing content visible
   - Navigation working properly

2. **Participant Authentication** - ‚úÖ PASS
   - Login form accessible
   - Participant credentials accepted (`abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com`)
   - Authentication successful with proper redirect
   - User role correctly identified as "participant"

3. **Participant Dashboard Access** - ‚úÖ PASS
   - Successfully redirected to `/app/participant-dashboard`
   - Dashboard UI loaded properly
   - Navigation menu visible with correct options:
     - My Applications
     - Discover Studies  
     - Settings
   - User profile displayed correctly

4. **Study Discovery Navigation** - ‚úÖ PASS
   - "Discover Studies" link working
   - Redirected to `/app/discover` successfully

### ‚ùå IDENTIFIED ISSUES

1. **Study Application Form - 401 Error** - ‚ùå FAIL
   - When clicking "Apply to Study", received 401 Unauthorized error
   - Page at `/app/studies/{id}/apply` not loading properly
   - Suggests backend API authentication issue for study application endpoint

2. **Study Discovery Content Loading** - ‚ùå PARTIAL FAIL
   - Initial study listing showed 1 study available ("E-commerce Checkout Flow Testing")
   - But main content area not loading fully on return navigation
   - May be related to API authentication or state management issues

### üîç Technical Findings

**Console Errors Detected:**
- `401 Unauthorized` error when accessing study application forms
- Authentication appears to work for login but fails for specific API endpoints

**Authentication Flow:**
- ‚úÖ Login successful - JWT token received
- ‚úÖ User role verification working
- ‚úÖ Dashboard access authorized
- ‚ùå Study-specific API endpoints failing authentication

**Available Study Data:**
- Found 1 public study: "E-commerce Checkout Flow Testing"
- Study details visible: $25 compensation, 30 minutes, 0/10 participants
- Study appears properly configured and public

## üìä Workflow Analysis

### COMPLETED WORKFLOW STEPS:
1. ‚úÖ **Participant Authentication** - Login successful
2. ‚úÖ **Dashboard Access** - Can access participant dashboard
3. ‚úÖ **Study Discovery** - Can browse available studies
4. ‚ùå **Study Application** - Failed due to 401 error
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Post-Approval Workflow** - Cannot test due to application failure

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The issue appears to be in the **study application API endpoints** on the production environment. While the participant can authenticate and access the dashboard, the specific endpoints for study applications are returning 401 errors.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **API Endpoint Missing:** The study application endpoints may not be deployed to production
2. **Authentication Mismatch:** JWT token format or validation differs between environments
3. **CORS Issues:** Cross-origin request configuration problems
4. **Database Permissions:** RLS (Row Level Security) policies too restrictive in production

## üîß RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check Production API Deployment:**
   - Verify `/api/participant-applications.js` is deployed
   - Verify `/api/studies/{id}/apply` endpoint exists
   - Check Vercel function logs for errors

2. **Test Local Development Environment:**
   - Run the same test on local development server
   - Compare API behavior between local and production

3. **Database Verification:**
   - Check if `study_applications` table exists in production
   - Verify RLS policies allow participant applications
   - Test with direct database queries

### Next Steps:
1. **Local Environment Testing** - Test complete workflow locally where we know APIs work
2. **Production API Debugging** - Fix the 401 authentication issues
3. **End-to-End Verification** - Complete the full post-approval workflow test

## üéâ POSITIVE FINDINGS

Despite the API issues, we successfully verified:
- ‚úÖ **Production deployment is working**
- ‚úÖ **Participant authentication system is functional**
- ‚úÖ **Frontend UI is properly deployed and working**
- ‚úÖ **Study discovery system shows available studies**
- ‚úÖ **User role management working correctly**

## ‚è≠Ô∏è NEXT: Local Development Test

Since the production environment has API authentication issues, we should:
1. Test the complete workflow on local development (where APIs are confirmed working)
2. Create test data (study + application + approval) in local environment
3. Verify the full post-approval study execution workflow
4. Document the complete "what happens after approval" process

**The core question remains:** *Can an approved participant successfully do a study after approval?*

We need to test this in the working local environment to get definitive results.
