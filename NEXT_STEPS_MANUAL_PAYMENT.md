# üéØ ResearchHub Manual Payment System - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Stripe Cleanup Status
**CONFIRMED CLEAN**: All manual payment components are 100% Stripe-free:
- ‚úÖ `ManualPaymentFlow.tsx` - Pure bank transfer implementation
- ‚úÖ `PaymentManagement.tsx` - Manual verification only 
- ‚úÖ Backend routes (`payments.ts`, `admin-payments.ts`) - No Stripe dependencies
- ‚úÖ Database models - Independent of Stripe schemas

## üöÄ Development Servers Running
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5175
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3002 (starting up)
- **Test Page**: Open `manual-payment-system-test.html` in browser

## üìã Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Testing & Validation** (First Priority)
```bash
# Open test environments
Frontend: http://localhost:5175
Admin Login: http://localhost:5175/login (admin credentials)

Test Suite: Open manual-payment-system-test.html
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Test user registration/login flow
- [ ] Navigate to billing settings (`/app/settings/billing`)
- [ ] Click manual payment option
- [ ] Complete payment flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test admin verification workflow

### 2. **Environment Configuration** (Production Ready)
