## 💡 Quick Tips While Testing

**If something doesn't work:**
- Don't panic! Just note it down
- Take a screenshot (Windows + Shift + S)
- Copy any error messages from console (F12)
- This is discovery - not fixing yet!

**If you see errors in console (F12):**
- Red errors = important, note these
- Yellow warnings = less urgent, note if many
- Take a screenshot of the errors

**If the app won't load:**
- Check if port 3003 is already in use
- Try stopping and restarting: Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev:fullstack` again
- Check terminal for any error messages
