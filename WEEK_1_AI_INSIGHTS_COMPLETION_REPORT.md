}
```

### Type-Safe AI Interfaces

```typescript
interface AIInsight {
  type: 'pattern' | 'sentiment' | 'pain_point' | 'opportunity';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  confidence: number; // 0-1
  actionable: boolean;
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

interface QualityScore {
  score: number; // 1-10
  reasoning: string;
  criteria: {
    completeness: number;
    depth: number;
    clarity: number;
    actionability: number;
    engagement: number;
  };
}
```

### Dashboard Component Features
