# Phase 2 Implementation Plan: Study-Specific Analytics

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE: Move Analytics Into Study Context**

Transform analytics from a global, separate page into study-specific, contextual insights that help researchers understand their individual study performance immediately.

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Create Enhanced Study Detail Page**
- Create tabbed interface for individual studies
- Move study-specific functionality into organized tabs
- Maintain all existing study functionality

### **Step 2: Integrate Study-Specific Analytics**
- Move detailed analytics to study context
- Create study-scoped analytics components
- Preserve global analytics for dashboard overview

### **Step 3: Study-Specific Collaboration**
- Add team collaboration scoped to individual studies
- Study-specific comments, approvals, and activity
- Maintain organization-level collaboration in dashboard

### **Step 4: Update Navigation & Routes**
- Update study routes to include tabbed interface
- Redirect analytics routes to study-specific context
- Maintain backward compatibility

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **New Study Detail Page Structure**
```tsx
<StudyDetailPage studyId={id}>
  <StudyHeader />                    // Study title, status, actions
  <StudyTabNavigation />             // Tab navigation
  <StudyTabContent>
    <OverviewTab />                  // Study details and quick metrics
    <BuilderTab />                   // Edit study (existing functionality)
    <AnalyticsTab />                 // THIS study's analytics
    <ParticipantsTab />              // Study participants
    <CollaborationTab />             // Study team collaboration
    <SettingsTab />                  // Study settings
  </StudyTabContent>
</StudyDetailPage>
```

### **Analytics Integration**
- **Study-Scoped APIs**: Analytics endpoints that filter by study ID
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Live study performance in context
- **Comparative Analytics**: Compare with user's other studies
- **Export Options**: Study-specific data export

### **Route Structure**
```
/app/studies/:id           → Study Overview Tab
/app/studies/:id/builder   → Study Builder Tab
/app/studies/:id/analytics → Study Analytics Tab
/app/studies/:id/participants → Study Participants Tab
/app/studies/:id/team      → Study Collaboration Tab
/app/studies/:id/settings  → Study Settings Tab
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED BENEFITS**

### **For Researchers**
- **Immediate Context**: Analytics for the study they're currently viewing
- **Faster Insights**: No filtering or searching through global analytics
- **Action-Oriented**: Can immediately edit study based on analytics insights
- **Complete Study Management**: All study functions in one place

### **For Teams**
- **Study-Focused Collaboration**: Team discussions about specific study
- **Contextual Decisions**: Analytics inform team collaboration
- **Efficient Workflow**: Study management and team coordination unified
