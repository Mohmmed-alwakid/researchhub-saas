jobs:
  uat:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run uat:all
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: uat-reports
          path: testing/reports/
```

### 2. Performance Benchmarking Integration
```bash
# Enhanced UAT with performance tracking
npm run uat:performance  # UAT + Lighthouse audits
npm run uat:baseline     # Establish performance baselines
