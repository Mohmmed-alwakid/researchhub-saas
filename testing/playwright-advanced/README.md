## Continuous Integration Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Advanced E2E Testing
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.advanced.js
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      if: always()
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: testing/playwright-reports/
        retention-days: 30
```

## Reporting & Analytics

### Test Reports Generated
- **HTML Report**: Visual test results with screenshots and videos
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable results for CI/CD integration
- **JUnit Report**: Compatible with standard testing frameworks

### Performance Metrics Tracked
- Page load times
- API response times  
- User interaction response times
- Memory usage during test execution
- Network request patterns

### Coverage Analysis
- Feature coverage percentage
- Code path coverage
- User journey coverage
- Error scenario coverage

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group tests by feature area
- Use descriptive test names
- Implement proper test cleanup
- Maintain test data isolation

### Error Handling
- Capture screenshots on failure
- Record videos for debugging
- Generate trace files for analysis
- Implement retry logic for flaky tests

### Performance Optimization
- Run tests in parallel when possible
- Use page object models for reusability
- Implement efficient selectors
- Minimize test execution time

## Integration with Development Workflow

```bash
# Quick smoke tests before commit
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.advanced.js --grep "smoke"
```

### Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
# Full test suite before production deploy
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.advanced.js
```

### Development Testing
