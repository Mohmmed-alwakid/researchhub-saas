## 🚀 Quick Start for Product Manager

### **1. Run Quick Validation**
```bash
npm run uat:quick
```
This provides immediate validation of all researcher workflows without full test execution.

### **2. Execute Full UAT Suite**
```bash
npm run uat:researcher
```
Runs comprehensive automated testing with detailed reporting.

### **3. Run Specific Playwright Tests**
```bash
npm run test:researcher-uat:playwright
```
Executes browser-based testing with visual validation.

## 📊 Test Results and Reporting

### **Automated Report Generation**
Every test run generates:
- **HTML Report:** `testing/reports/researcher-uat-[timestamp].html`
- **Pass/Fail Summary:** Console output with success rates
- **Error Details:** Specific failure information for debugging
- **Screenshots:** Visual evidence of test execution

### **Success Metrics**
- **Target Success Rate:** 95%+ for all UAT scenarios
- **Critical Path Coverage:** 100% of researcher workflows
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Page load < 3s, API response < 500ms
- **Browser Compatibility:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari support

## 🎯 Test Account Configuration

**Using Mandatory Test Accounts (REQUIRED):**

```javascript
