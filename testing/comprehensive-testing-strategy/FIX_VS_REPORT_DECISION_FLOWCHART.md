## ‚ö° Fix Immediately Criteria

### **Must Fix Now:**
- **Broken Core Workflows**: Users cannot complete primary tasks
- **Authentication Failures**: Login, logout, registration not working
- **Data Loss**: User progress/data not saving or corrupting
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Exposed sensitive information
- **Critical Performance**: Page load times >10 seconds
- **Complete Accessibility Failure**: Keyboard navigation entirely broken
- **Payment Issues**: Payment processing or calculations incorrect

### **Examples of "Fix Immediately":**
- ‚úÖ "Apply to Study" button doesn't work
- ‚úÖ Study progress lost when browser refreshed
- ‚úÖ User can see other users' private data
- ‚úÖ Study creation wizard crashes on Step 3
- ‚úÖ Mobile app completely unusable (no scrolling, buttons unreachable)
- ‚úÖ Payments deducted but study not created

## üìù Report for Later Criteria

### **Can Wait for Prioritization:**
- **Visual Polish**: Minor styling inconsistencies
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: Nice-to-have features
- **Non-Critical Performance**: 3-5 second load times
- **Minor UI Issues**: Small alignment or spacing problems
- **Documentation**: Missing help text or tooltips
- **Advanced Features**: Complex features that aren't core to basic functionality

### **Examples of "Report for Later":**
- ‚ùå Study cards have inconsistent padding
- ‚ùå Filter dropdown could have better animations
- ‚ùå Missing "Remember Me" checkbox on login
- ‚ùå Help tooltips could be more detailed
- ‚ùå Advanced search features not available
- ‚ùå Export functionality missing but not essential

## üéØ Context-Specific Guidelines

### **For Participants:**
- **Fix**: Cannot discover, apply to, or complete studies
- **Report**: UI improvements, additional filters, enhanced features

### **For Researchers:**
- **Fix**: Cannot create, manage, or publish studies
- **Report**: Template improvements, analytics enhancements, workflow optimizations

### **For Admins:**
- **Fix**: Cannot manage users, moderate content, or access critical data
- **Report**: Dashboard improvements, additional reporting features, UI enhancements

## üöÄ Emergency vs. Standard Fix Process

### **Emergency Fix Process (High Priority)**
1. **Document Issue**: Screenshot, steps to reproduce, impact assessment
2. **Immediate Mitigation**: Temporary workaround if possible
3. **Developer Assignment**: Assign to developer immediately
4. **Testing**: Quick verification fix works
5. **Deployment**: Deploy fix ASAP with minimal additional changes

### **Standard Report Process (Low Priority)**
1. **Log Issue**: Add to project management system with details
2. **Impact Assessment**: Document affected users and use cases
3. **Prioritization**: Add to backlog with priority ranking
4. **Sprint Planning**: Include in upcoming sprint planning sessions
5. **Development**: Address during normal development cycle

## üìä Issue Classification Examples

### **Severity 1 (Fix Immediately)**
```
Example: User clicks "Create Study" ‚Üí Page crashes with error
Impact: Researchers cannot create studies (core functionality broken)
Action: Fix immediately - this blocks primary user goal
```

### **Severity 2 (Report - High Priority)**
```
Example: Study creation works but takes 8 seconds to load
Impact: Poor user experience but functionality works
Action: Report for optimization in next sprint
```

### **Severity 3 (Report - Medium Priority)**
```
Example: Study card images sometimes don't align perfectly
Impact: Minor visual inconsistency, doesn't affect functionality
Action: Report for UI polish during next design review
```

### **Severity 4 (Report - Low Priority)**
```
Example: Advanced export feature missing from admin dashboard
Impact: Nice-to-have feature, workarounds available
Action: Report for future feature development
```

## üîÑ When Classifications Change

### **Escalation Triggers:**
- Multiple users report the same "Report" issue
- Minor issue prevents users from workarounds
- Business impact increases (e.g., customer complaints)
- Issue affects larger user base than initially thought

### **De-escalation Triggers:**
- Workaround solutions discovered
- User adaptation to current interface
- Higher priority issues require resources
- Issue impact lower than initially assessed

## üì± Platform-Specific Considerations

### **Mobile Issues:**
- **Fix**: Interface unusable, core functions broken
- **Report**: Minor responsive design improvements

### **Desktop Issues:**
- **Fix**: Critical functionality broken
- **Report**: Browser-specific minor issues

### **Cross-Platform Issues:**
