# ResearchHub - Detailed User Stories & Test Cases

## 🚨 Fix vs. Report Decision Framework

### **Fix Immediately:**
- **Broken Authentication**: Login/logout/registration failures
- **Critical User Experience**: Broken navigation, missing essential buttons
- **Data Loss**: Progress not saving, forms not submitting
- **Security Issues**: Exposed sensitive data, authentication bypasses
- **Core Functionality**: Study creation/completion broken
- **Performance Blockers**: Page load times >10 seconds
- **Accessibility Violations**: Complete keyboard navigation failures

### **Report for Later:**
- **Visual Polish**: Minor styling inconsistencies, color variations
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: Feature improvements, UX optimizations
- **Non-Critical Performance**: Load times 3-5 seconds (note but don't block)
- **Nice-to-Have Features**: Missing advanced filters, additional sorting options
- **Minor UI Issues**: Misaligned elements, small responsive design issues
- **Documentation**: Missing help text, incomplete tooltips

### **Decision Process:**
1. **Ask**: Does this prevent users from completing their core task?
2. **Ask**: Is this a security or data integrity issue?
3. **Ask**: Would this cause user frustration or abandonment?
4. **If YES to any**: Fix immediately
5. **If NO to all**: Report for prioritization
