# Study Creation Flow - UI/UX Improvements
## June 25, 2025

## üéØ **UX Issues Identified**

### **Critical UX Friction Points**
1. **Step Navigation Confusion**: Current step numbering doesn't adapt well when session step is skipped
2. **Loading States Missing**: No feedback during transitions or form submissions
3. **Error Handling**: Limited visual feedback for validation errors
4. **Accessibility Gaps**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation issues
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Step navigation breaks on smaller screens
6. **Progress Persistence**: No visual indication of saved progress

### **Proposed Solutions**

#### **1. Enhanced Step Navigation**
- Implement adaptive step numbering that reflows naturally
- Add animated transitions between steps
- Show estimated time per step
- Add progress percentage indicator

#### **2. Improved Feedback Systems**
- Loading spinners and skeleton screens
- Real-time validation with gentle error styling
- Success animations for completed steps
- Auto-save indicators

#### **3. Accessibility Enhancements**
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimizations
- Color contrast improvements
- Focus management between steps

#### **4. Mobile-First Responsive Design**
- Collapsible step navigation for mobile
- Touch-friendly form controls
- Optimized form layouts for smaller screens
- Swipe gestures for step navigation
