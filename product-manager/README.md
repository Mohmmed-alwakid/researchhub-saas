# 💼 PRODUCT MANAGER CENTRAL COMMAND

**Date Created**: June 29, 2025  
**Purpose**: Centralized product management and decision-making hub for ResearchHub  
**Status**: 🟢 Active - Primary source of truth for all product decisions

## 🎯 WHAT THIS FOLDER SOLVES

### ❌ BEFORE (Problems)
- 50+ scattered .MD files across project root
- Inconsistent AI outputs for same requests
- No single source of truth for decisions
- Requirements scattered everywhere
- Difficulty understanding project context

### ✅ AFTER (Solutions)
- **Single source of truth** for all product decisions
- **Consistent AI outputs** through comprehensive context
- **Organized requirements** with clear approval status
- **Strategic roadmap** with clear priorities
- **Clean project structure** with archived legacy docs

## 🚀 HOW TO USE THIS SYSTEM

### For Feature Requests
1. **Requirements**: Check `requirements/approved/` for existing specs
2. **Context**: Review `MASTER_CONTEXT.md` for full project understanding
3. **Process**: Follow templates in `requirements/templates/`
4. **Decision**: Log in appropriate `decisions/` file

### For AI Consistency
- **Primary Source**: `MASTER_CONTEXT.md` contains everything AI needs
- **Current Focus**: `CURRENT_STATUS.md` shows active priorities
- **Guardrails**: `requirements/templates/` ensure consistent formatting

### For Strategic Planning
- **Vision**: `roadmap/STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md` - long-term direction
- **Execution**: `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` - what we're building now
- **Future**: `BACKLOG.md` - prioritized feature list
