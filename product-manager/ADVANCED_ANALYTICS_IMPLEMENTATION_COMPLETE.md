## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **API Architecture**
```javascript
// Analytics API endpoints structure
GET /api/blocks?action=analytics&studyId={id}&type={type}

Types supported:
- overview: Study overview metrics
- responses: Detailed response analysis  
- blocks: Block-specific analytics
- export: CSV data export
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **Collection**: Participant responses stored in `block_responses` table
2. **Processing**: Analytics API aggregates and calculates metrics
3. **Visualization**: Frontend dashboard renders charts and metrics
4. **Export**: Researchers can download data as CSV

### **Analytics Calculations**
- **Completion Rate**: `(completed_sessions / total_sessions) * 100`
- **Engagement Score**: Multi-factor scoring based on response quality and time
- **Dropoff Analysis**: Identification of specific blocks where participants exit
- **Time Analysis**: Session duration distribution and averages
