## üõ°Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT RULES & CONVENTIONS

### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript**: 100% type coverage, 0 compilation errors
- **Testing**: Local testing first with provided test accounts
- **Architecture**: Prefer extending existing code over creating new
- **Documentation**: Update all relevant docs with changes

### Test Accounts (MANDATORY - Use Only These)
```
Participant: abwanwr77+participant@gmail.com (Testtest123)
Researcher:  abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com (Testtest123)
Admin:       abwanwr77+admin@gmail.com (Testtest123)
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Requirements Phase**: Document requirements before coding
2. **Analysis Phase**: Understand existing code and patterns
3. **Implementation Phase**: Build following approved plan
4. **Testing Phase**: Verify functionality and no regressions

### Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)
- Create new systems when existing can be enhanced
- Start coding without detailed requirements
- Replace working code instead of extending it
- Break existing functionality

---

## üìä CURRENT SPRINT PRIORITIES
