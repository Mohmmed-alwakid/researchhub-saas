## 🔧 **ALTERNATIVE: Fix Local Setup**

**If you prefer local control:**

### **Option A: Update Node.js**
```powershell
# Download Node.js 20.19+ from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
# Install new version
# Restart PowerShell
# Then: n8n start
```

### **Option B: Use Docker (fix previous issue)**
```powershell
# Start Docker Desktop (if installed)
# If not installed: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
cd D:\MAMP\AfakarM\n8n-workflows
docker-compose up -d
# Access at: http://localhost:5678
```
