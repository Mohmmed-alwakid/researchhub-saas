## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: UNDER DEVELOPMENT - NOT PRODUCTION READY
**Last Updated**: December 28, 2024  
**Status**: üöß Early Development Stage - Major Features Missing  

This directory contains comprehensive Copilot instruction files to guide AI-assisted development for the ResearchHub project.

## üìÅ Instruction Files Overview

### Core Instructions
- **`copilot-instructions.md`** - Main project overview, tech stack, and coding conventions ‚≠ê **PRIMARY FILE**
- **`copilot-development-guide.md`** - Development workflow, architecture patterns, and common code examples
- **`copilot-api-reference.md`** - Current API endpoint documentation (limited implementation)
- **`copilot-troubleshooting.md`** - Common issues, debugging commands, and emergency fixes
- **`copilot-testing-deployment.md`** - Testing strategies and local development setup

## üéØ How to Use These Instructions

### For GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot automatically reads the main `copilot-instructions.md` file when making suggestions. The additional files provide detailed context for specific development scenarios.

### For Copilot Chat
Reference specific instruction files in your chat queries:

```bash
@copilot What's the authentication flow according to the API reference?
@copilot How do I troubleshoot TypeScript errors based on the troubleshooting guide?
@copilot Show me the current project status and limitations.
```

### For VS Code Extensions
These instructions work with various AI coding assistants and provide comprehensive context about:

- Project structure and conventions
- Current API endpoints (limited implementation)
- Common development patterns
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Local development workflows

## üîÑ Maintenance

These instruction files should be updated when:

- ‚úÖ New features are added to the project
- ‚úÖ API endpoints change or are added
- ‚úÖ Development workflow changes
- ‚úÖ New troubleshooting scenarios are discovered
- ‚úÖ Project status evolves
