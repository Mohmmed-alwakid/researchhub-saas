## 🚀 **PRIORITY 1: COMPLETE AUTHENTICATION FLOW**

### **Goal:** Make login actually work end-to-end

**Current Issue:** Authentication API works, but frontend doesn't redirect after login

**Tasks:**
1. **Fix Frontend Auth Integration**
   - Debug why login response isn't processed
   - Implement token storage in auth store
   - Add automatic redirect to dashboard

2. **Test All User Roles**
   - Researcher dashboard flow
   - Admin panel access
   - Participant experience

**Impact:** 🔥 **HIGH** - Users can actually access the application

## 🚀 **PRIORITY 2: RESEARCHER DASHBOARD**

### **Goal:** Core researcher experience

**Tasks:**
1. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Study overview cards
   - Recent activity feed  
   - Quick actions (Create Study, View Results)

2. **Navigation Enhancement**
   - Role-based menu items
   - Breadcrumb navigation
   - User profile dropdown

**Impact:** 🔥 **HIGH** - Primary user experience complete

## 🚀 **PRIORITY 3: LIVE COLLABORATION INTEGRATION**

### **Goal:** Connect frontend to WebSocket backend

**What's Ready:**
- ✅ WebSocket server fully operational
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ Message handling implemented

**Tasks:**
1. **Frontend WebSocket Client**
   - Connect to ws://localhost:8080
   - Handle real-time messages
   - Show live user presence

2. **Study Builder Collaboration**
   - Live cursor tracking
   - Real-time block editing
   - Live activity feed

**Impact:** 🔥 **HIGH** - Unique selling point, team collaboration

---

## 🚀 **PRIORITY 4: STUDY CREATION WORKFLOW**

### **Goal:** Complete study builder integration

**Tasks:**
1. **Enhanced Study Builder**
   - Block library integration
   - Template selection
   - Preview functionality

2. **Study Management**
   - Save/load studies
   - Study status tracking
   - Launch functionality

**Impact:** 🔥 **MEDIUM** - Core functionality completion

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION**

### **START WITH: Fix Authentication Flow**

**Why:** Everything else depends on users being able to log in properly.

**Quick Win Tasks:**
1. Debug frontend auth store integration
2. Add token storage and persistence  
3. Implement redirect after successful login
4. Test with all 3 user roles

**Expected Time:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** Users can actually use the application

---

## 🛠️ **DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Authentication (This Week)**
- Fix login redirect issue
- Complete auth flow for all user types
- Add role-based routing

### **Phase 2: Core Experience (Next Week)**  
- Researcher dashboard
- Basic study management
- User profile management

### **Phase 3: Collaboration (Following Week)**
- Live WebSocket integration
- Real-time collaboration features
- Team workspace functionality

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)**
- Study analytics
- Advanced block types
- Integration with external tools

---

## 🎯 **SPECIFIC NEXT ACTION RECOMMENDATION**

**Start Here:** 
```bash
# 1. Test current auth API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/auth-consolidated?action=login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"abwanwr77+Researcher@gmail.com","password":"Testtest123"}'

# 2. Debug frontend auth store
# Check: src/stores/authStore.ts
# Check: src/components/auth/ 
# Check: API response handling

# 3. Fix redirect after login
# Implement: Dashboard routing
# Add: Token persistence
# Test: All user roles
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ User logs in → automatically redirected to dashboard
- ✅ Dashboard shows user-specific content  
- ✅ Tokens persist across browser sessions
- ✅ Role-based access working

---

## 🏆 **ULTIMATE GOAL**

**Create a fully functional research platform where:**
1. **Researchers** can create studies with live collaboration
2. **Participants** can complete studies seamlessly  
3. **Admins** can manage the platform efficiently
4. **Teams** can collaborate in real-time

**Next milestone:** Complete authentication → functional researcher dashboard → live collaboration
