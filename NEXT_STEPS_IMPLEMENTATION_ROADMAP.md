# 🚀 NEXT STEPS & IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

**Based on Post-Approval Workflow Testing - June 22, 2025**

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### 🔥 CRITICAL (Fix Production Issues)

1. **Deploy Missing API Endpoints to Production**
   ```bash
   # Deploy these API endpoints to Vercel:
   - /api/participant-applications.js
   - /api/researcher-applications.js  
   - /api/recordings (session management)
   ```
   **Priority:** HIGH - Required for production functionality
   **ETA:** 1-2 hours

2. **Fix Production Authentication Issues**
   - Debug 401 errors on study application endpoints
   - Verify JWT token validation consistency
   - Test API endpoint access in production environment
   **Priority:** HIGH - Blocks participant workflow
   **ETA:** 2-3 hours

### 🎯 TESTING & VALIDATION

3. **Create Test Data for End-to-End Testing**
   ```sql
   -- Create approved study application for testing
   INSERT INTO study_applications (study_id, participant_id, status, applied_at)
   VALUES ('existing-study-id', 'participant-user-id', 'approved', NOW());
   ```
   **Priority:** MEDIUM - Enables full workflow testing
   **ETA:** 30 minutes

4. **Complete Browser Automation Setup**
   - Fix Playwright version compatibility issues
   - Create automated test suite for regression testing
   - Set up CI/CD testing pipeline
   **Priority:** LOW - Nice to have for automated testing
   **ETA:** 2-4 hours
