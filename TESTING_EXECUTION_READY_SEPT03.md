[error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
```

### Impact Assessment
- **User Experience**: Broken - participants cannot apply to studies
- **Research Workflow**: Blocked - study creation/application flow fails
- **Launch Readiness**: ❌ **NOT READY** - Critical backend fixes required

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED 🔥

### Priority 1: Backend API Stability
1. **Investigate 500 errors** in production API endpoints
2. **Fix application submission** `/api/applications` endpoint
3. **Repair study fetching** `/api/research` endpoint
4. **Validate all consolidated APIs** are functioning

### Priority 2: Study Creation Flow
1. **Fix block builder** navigation issues
2. **Test complete study creation** end-to-end
3. **Verify study persistence** in database

### Priority 3: Integration Testing
1. **Rerun MCP Playwright tests** after fixes
2. **Validate complete user flows** work properly
3. **Confirm data persistence** throughout workflows
