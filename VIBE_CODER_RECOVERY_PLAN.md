# üéØ ResearchHub Recovery - Vibe-Coder Implementation Plan

**Created:** October 3, 2025  
**Methodology:** Vibe-Coder-MCP (Proven successful in July 2025)  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks  
**Status:** Phase 0 - Discovery

‚úÖ **Production Status:** HEALTHY (https://researchhub-saas.vercel.app)  
‚úÖ **API Health:** Working (200 OK)  
‚úÖ **Code Quality:** No critical TypeScript errors  
‚úÖ **Architecture:** Solid foundation with 80% features complete  

### The Problem
- Developer stuck in "fix one thing, break another" loop for 1 month
- Loss of confidence in making changes
- Unclear what works vs what's broken
- No systematic development process

### The Solution
Apply proven Vibe-Coder-MCP methodology that successfully delivered:
- 95% reduction in manual testing
- 40% faster development cycles
- 80% improvement in bug detection
- 50% API performance improvement

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Core Principles (From Vibe-Coder Success)
1. **Incremental Changes** - Small, testable modifications
2. **Immediate Validation** - Test after every change
3. **Safety First** - Always maintain rollback capability
4. **Documentation** - Document before, during, and after
5. **Systematic Approach** - Follow the proven phase-by-phase model

## üõ†Ô∏è Daily Development Workflow (Vibe-Coder Method)

### Every Morning Routine
```powershell
# 1. Health check
.\quick-check.ps1

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 3. Review today's goals
# Look at this plan and focus on today's tasks only
```

### Before Making Any Change
```powershell
# 1. Create feature branch (if new work)
git checkout -b fix-[issue-name]-[date]

# 2. Review requirements
# Read the issue description above

# 3. Write tests FIRST
# Know what success looks like before coding
```

### During Development (Repeat This Cycle)
```powershell
# 1. Make ONE small change (1-2 files)
# Edit code

# 2. Test IMMEDIATELY
npm run dev:fullstack
# Open http://localhost:5175
# Test the specific feature you changed

# 3. Decision point:
# ‚úÖ If works:
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed: [specific thing]"

# ‚ùå If breaks:
git reset --hard HEAD
# Try again with a SMALLER change
```

### End of Day Routine
```powershell
# 1. Run comprehensive tests
npm run test:quick

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin [branch-name]

# 3. Document progress
# Update this file with what you accomplished

# 4. Plan tomorrow
# Review next day's tasks in this document
```
